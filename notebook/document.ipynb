In the absence\\nof labeled data for a certain task, domain adap-\\ntation often provides an attractive option given\\nthat labeled data of similar nature but from a dif-\\nferent domain (e.g. synthetic images) are avail-\\nable. Here, we propose a new approach to do-\\nmain adaptation in deep architectures that can\\nbe trained on large amount of labeled data from\\nthe source domain and large amount of unlabeled\\ndata from the target domain (no labeled target-\\ndomain data is necessary).\\nAs the training progresses, the approach pro-\\nmotes the emergence of “deep” features that are\\n(i) discriminative for the main learning task on\\nthe source domain and (ii) invariant with respect\\nto the shift between the domains. We show that\\nthis adaptation behaviour can be achieved in al-\\nmost any feed-forward model by augmenting it\\nwith few standard layers and a simple new gra-\\ndient reversal layer.\\nThe resulting augmented\\narchitecture can be trained using standard back-\\npropagation.\\nOverall, the approach can be implemented with\\nlittle effort using any of the deep-learning pack-\\nages. The method performs very well in a se-\\nries of image classiﬁcation experiments, achiev-\\ning adaptation effect in the presence of big do-\\nmain shifts and outperforming previous state-of-\\nthe-art on Ofﬁce datasets.\\n1. Introduction\\nDeep feed-forward architectures have brought impressive\\nadvances to the state-of-the-art across a wide variety of\\nmachine-learning tasks and applications. At the moment,\\nhowever, these leaps in performance come only when a\\nlarge amount of labeled training data is available. At the\\nsame time, for problems lacking labeled data, it may be\\nstill possible to obtain training sets that are big enough for\\ntraining large-scale deep models, but that suffer from the\\nshift in data distribution from the actual data encountered\\nat “test time”. One particularly important example is syn-\\nthetic or semi-synthetic training data, which may come in\\nabundance and be fully labeled, but which inevitably have\\na distribution that is different from real data (Liebelt &\\nSchmid, 2010; Stark et al., 2010; V´azquez et al., 2014; Sun\\n& Saenko, 2014).\\nLearning a discriminative classiﬁer or other predictor in\\nthe presence of a shift between training and test distribu-\\ntions is known as domain adaptation (DA). A number of\\napproaches to domain adaptation has been suggested in the\\ncontext of shallow learning, e.g. in the situation when data\\nrepresentation/features are given and ﬁxed. The proposed\\napproaches then build the mappings between the source\\n(training-time) and the target (test-time) domains, so that\\nthe classiﬁer learned for the source domain can also be ap-\\nplied to the target domain, when composed with the learned\\nmapping between domains.\\nThe appeal of the domain\\nadaptation approaches is the ability to learn a mapping be-\\ntween domains in the situation when the target domain data\\nare either fully unlabeled (unsupervised domain annota-\\ntion) or have few labeled samples (semi-supervised domain\\nadaptation). Below, we focus on the harder unsupervised\\ncase, although the proposed approach can be generalized to\\nthe semi-supervised case rather straightforwardly.\\nUnlike most previous papers on domain adaptation that\\nworked with ﬁxed feature representations, we focus on\\ncombining domain adaptation and deep feature learning\\nwithin one training process (deep domain adaptation). Our\\ngoal is to embed domain adaptation into the process of\\nlearning representation, so that the ﬁnal classiﬁcation de-\\ncisions are made based on features that are both discrim-\\ninative and invariant to the change of domains, i.e. have\\nthe same or very similar distributions in the source and the\\ntarget domains. In this way, the obtained feed-forward net-\\nwork can be applicable to the target domain without being\\nhindered by the shift between the two domains.\\nWe thus focus on learning features that combine (i)\\ndiscriminativeness and (ii) domain-invariance.\\nThis is\\nachieved by jointly optimizing the underlying features as\\nwell as two discriminative classiﬁers operating on these\\nfeatures: (i) the label predictor that predicts class labels\\nand is used both during training and at test time and (ii) the\\narXiv:1409.7495v2  [stat.ML]  27 Feb 2015'),\n",

While the parameters of\\nthe classiﬁers are optimized in order to minimize their error\\non the training set, the parameters of the underlying deep\\nfeature mapping are optimized in order to minimize the loss\\nof the label classiﬁer and to maximize the loss of the domain\\nclassiﬁer. The latter encourages domain-invariant features\\nto emerge in the course of the optimization.\\nCrucially, we show that all three training processes can\\nbe embedded into an appropriately composed deep feed-\\nforward network (Figure 1) that uses standard layers and\\nloss functions, and can be trained using standard backprop-\\nagation algorithms based on stochastic gradient descent or\\nits modiﬁcations (e.g. SGD with momentum).\\nOur ap-\\nproach is generic as it can be used to add domain adaptation\\nto any existing feed-forward architecture that is trainable by\\nbackpropagation. In practice, the only non-standard com-\\nponent of the proposed architecture is a rather trivial gra-\\ndient reversal layer that leaves the input unchanged during\\nforward propagation and reverses the gradient by multiply-\\ning it by a negative scalar during the backpropagation.\\nBelow, we detail the proposed approach to domain adap-\\ntation in deep architectures, and present results on tradi-\\ntional deep learning image datasets (such as MNIST (Le-\\nCun et al., 1998) and SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011)) as well\\nas on OFFICE benchmarks (Saenko et al., 2010), where\\nthe proposed method considerably improves over previous\\nstate-of-the-art accuracy.\\n2. Related work\\nA large number of domain adaptation methods have been\\nproposed over the recent years, and here we focus on the\\nmost related ones.\\nMultiple methods perform unsuper-\\nvised domain adaptation by matching the feature distri-\\nbutions in the source and the target domains. Some ap-\\nproaches perform this by reweighing or selecting samples\\nfrom the source domain (Borgwardt et al., 2006; Huang\\net al., 2006; Gong et al., 2013), while others seek an ex-\\nplicit feature space transformation that would map source\\ndistribution into the target ones (Pan et al., 2011; Gopalan\\net al., 2011; Baktashmotlagh et al., 2013). An important\\naspect of the distribution matching approach is the way the\\n(dis)similarity between distributions is measured.\\nHere,\\none popular choice is matching the distribution means in\\nthe kernel-reproducing Hilbert space (Borgwardt et al.,\\n2006; Huang et al., 2006), whereas (Gong et al., 2012; Fer-\\nnando et al., 2013) map the principal axes associated with\\neach of the distributions. Our approach also attempts to\\nmatch feature space distributions, however this is accom-\\nplished by modifying the feature representation itself rather\\nthan by reweighing or geometric transformation. Also, our\\nmethod uses (implicitly) a rather different way to measure\\nthe disparity between distributions based on their separa-\\nbility by a deep discriminatively-trained classiﬁer.\\nSeveral approaches perform gradual transition from the\\nsource to the target domain (Gopalan et al., 2011; Gong\\net al., 2012) by a gradual change of the training distribu-\\ntion. Among these methods, (S. Chopra & Gopalan, 2013)\\ndoes this in a “deep” way by the layerwise training of a\\nsequence of deep autoencoders, while gradually replacing\\nsource-domain samples with target-domain samples. This\\nimproves over a similar approach of (Glorot et al., 2011)\\nthat simply trains a single deep autoencoder for both do-\\nmains. In both approaches, the actual classiﬁer/predictor\\nis learned in a separate step using the feature representa-\\ntion learned by autoencoder(s). In contrast to (Glorot et al.,\\n2011; S. Chopra & Gopalan, 2013), our approach performs\\nfeature learning, domain adaptation and classiﬁer learning\\njointly, in a uniﬁed architecture, and using a single learning\\nalgorithm (backpropagation). We therefore argue that our\\napproach is simpler (both conceptually and in terms of its\\nimplementation). Our method also achieves considerably\\nbetter results on the popular OFFICE benchmark.\\nWhile the above approaches perform unsupervised domain\\nadaptation, there are approaches that perform supervised\\ndomain adaptation by exploiting labeled data from the tar-\\nget domain.\\nIn the context of deep feed-forward archi-\\ntectures, such data can be used to “ﬁne-tune” the net-\\nwork trained on the source domain (Zeiler & Fergus, 2013;\\nOquab et al., 2014; Babenko et al., 2014). Our approach\\ndoes not require labeled target-domain data. At the same\\ntime, it can easily incorporate such data when it is avail-\\nable.\\nAn idea related to ours is described in (Goodfellow et al.,\\n2014). While their goal is quite different (building gener-\\native deep networks that can synthesize samples), the way\\nthey measure and minimize the discrepancy between the\\ndistribution of the training data and the distribution of the\\nsynthesized data is very similar to the way our architecture\\nmeasures and minimizes the discrepancy between feature\\ndistributions for the two domains.\\nFinally, a recent and concurrent report by (Tzeng et al.,\\n2014) also focuses on domain adaptation in feed-forward\\nnetworks. Their set of techniques measures and minimizes\\nthe distance of the data means across domains. This ap-\\nproach may be regarded as a “ﬁrst-order” approximation\\nto our approach, which seeks a tighter alignment between\\ndistributions.\\n3. Deep Domain Adaptation\\n3.1. The model\\nWe now detail the proposed model for the domain adap-\\ntation. We assume that the model works with input sam-\\nples x ∈X, where X is some input space and cer-\\ntain labels (output) y from the label space Y .\\nBelow,\\nwe assume classiﬁcation problems where Y is a ﬁnite set\\n(Y = {1, 2, . . . L}), however our approach is generic and\\ncan handle any output label space that other deep feed-'),\n",

The proposed architecture includes a deep feature extractor (green) and a deep label predictor (blue), which together form\\na standard feed-forward architecture. Unsupervised domain adaptation is achieved by adding a domain classiﬁer (red) connected to the\\nfeature extractor via a gradient reversal layer that multiplies the gradient by a certain negative constant during the backpropagation-\\nbased training. Otherwise, the training proceeds in a standard way and minimizes the label prediction loss (for source examples) and\\nthe domain classiﬁcation loss (for all samples). Gradient reversal ensures that the feature distributions over the two domains are made\\nsimilar (as indistinguishable as possible for the domain classiﬁer), thus resulting in the domain-invariant features.\\nforward models can handle. We further assume that there\\nexist two distributions S(x, y) and T (x, y) on X ⊗Y ,\\nwhich will be referred to as the source distribution and\\nthe target distribution (or the source domain and the tar-\\nget domain). Both distributions are assumed complex and\\nunknown, and furthermore similar but different (in other\\nwords, S is “shifted” from T by some domain shift).\\nOur ultimate goal is to be able to predict labels y given\\nthe input x for the target distribution.

For the ex-\\namples from the source distribution (di=0) the correspond-\\ning labels yi ∈Y are known at training time. For the ex-\\namples from the target domains, we do not know the labels\\nat training time, and we want to predict such labels at test\\ntime.\\nWe now deﬁne a deep feed-forward architecture that for\\neach input x predicts its label y ∈Y and its domain label\\nd ∈{0, 1}. We decompose such mapping into three parts.\\nWe assume that the input x is ﬁrst mapped by a mapping\\nGf (a feature extractor) to a D-dimensional feature vector\\nf ∈RD. The feature mapping may also include several\\nfeed-forward layers and we denote the vector of parame-\\nters of all layers in this mapping as θf, i.e. f = Gf(x; θf).\\nThen, the feature vector f is mapped by a mapping Gy (la-\\nbel predictor) to the label y, and we denote the parameters\\nof this mapping with θy. Finally, the same feature vector f\\nis mapped to the domain label d by a mapping Gd (domain\\nclassiﬁer) with the parameters θd (Figure 1).\\nDuring the learning stage, we aim to minimize the label\\nprediction loss on the annotated part (i.e. the source part)\\nof the training set, and the parameters of both the feature\\nextractor and the label predictor are thus optimized in or-\\nder to minimize the empirical loss for the source domain\\nsamples. This ensures the discriminativeness of the fea-\\ntures f and the overall good prediction performance of the\\ncombination of the feature extractor and the label predictor\\non the source domain.\\nAt the same time, we want to make the features f\\ndomain-invariant.\\nThat is, we want to make the dis-\\ntributions S(f) = {Gf(x; θf) | x∼S(x)} and T(f) =\\n{Gf(x; θf) | x∼T(x)} to be similar. Under the covariate\\nshift assumption, this would make the label prediction ac-\\ncuracy on the target domain to be the same as on the source\\ndomain (Shimodaira, 2000). Measuring the dissimilarity\\nof the distributions S(f) and T(f) is however non-trivial,\\ngiven that f is high-dimensional, and that the distributions\\nthemselves are constantly changing as learning progresses.\\nOne way to estimate the dissimilarity is to look at the loss\\nof the domain classiﬁer Gd, provided that the parameters\\nθd of the domain classiﬁer have been trained to discrim-\\ninate between the two feature distributions in an optimal\\nway.\\nThis observation leads to our idea. At training time, in or-\\nder to obtain domain-invariant features, we seek the param-\\neters θf of the feature mapping that maximize the loss of\\nthe domain classiﬁer (by making the two feature distribu-\\ntions as similar as possible), while simultaneously seeking\\nthe parameters θd of the domain classiﬁer that minimize the\\nloss of the domain classiﬁer. In addition, we seek to mini-\\nmize the loss of the label predictor.'),\n",

The\\nfeature mapping parameters θf minimize the label predic-\\ntion loss (i.e. the features are discriminative), while maxi-\\nmizing the domain classiﬁcation loss (i.e. the features are\\ndomain-invariant). The parameter λ controls the trade-off\\nbetween the two objectives that shape the features during\\nlearning.\\nBelow, we demonstrate that standard stochastic gradient\\nsolvers (SGD) can be adapted for the search of the saddle\\npoint (2)-(3).\\n3.2.

The difference is the −λ factor\\nin (4) (the difference is important, as without such factor,\\nstochastic gradient descent would try to make features dis-\\nsimilar across domains in order to minimize the domain\\nclassiﬁcation loss). Although direct implementation of (4)-\\n(6) as SGD is not possible, it is highly desirable to reduce\\nthe updates (4)-(6) to some form of SGD, since SGD (and\\nits variants) is the main learning algorithm implemented in\\nmost packages for deep learning.\\nFortunately, such reduction can be accomplished by intro-\\nducing a special gradient reversal layer (GRL) deﬁned as\\nfollows. The gradient reversal layer has no parameters as-\\nsociated with it (apart from the meta-parameter λ, which\\nis not updated by backpropagation). During the forward\\npropagation, GRL acts as an identity transform. During\\nthe backpropagation though, GRL takes the gradient from\\nthe subsequent level, multiplies it by −λ and passes it to\\nthe preceding layer. Implementing such layer using exist-\\ning object-oriented packages for deep learning is simple, as\\ndeﬁning procedures for forwardprop (identity transform),\\nbackprop (multiplying by a constant), and parameter up-\\ndate (nothing) is trivial.\\nThe GRL as deﬁned above is inserted between the feature\\nextractor and the domain classiﬁer, resulting in the archi-\\ntecture depicted in Figure 1. As the backpropagation pro-\\ncess passes through the GRL, the partial derivatives of the\\nloss that is downstream the GRL (i.e. Ld) w.r.t. the layer\\nparameters that are upstream the GRL (i.e. θf) get multi-\\nplied by −λ, i.e. ∂Ld\\n∂θf is effectively replaced with −λ ∂Ld\\n∂θf .\\nTherefore, running SGD in the resulting model implements\\nthe updates (4)-(6) and converges to a saddle point of (1).\\nMathematically, we can formally treat the gradient reversal\\nlayer as a “pseudo-function” Rλ(x) deﬁned by two (incom-\\npatible) equations describing its forward- and backpropa-\\ngation behaviour:\\nRλ(x) = x\\n(7)\\ndRλ\\ndx = −λI\\n(8)\\nwhere I is an identity matrix.\\nWe can then deﬁne the\\nobjective “pseudo-function” of (θf, θy, θd) that is being\\noptimized by the stochastic gradient descent within our\\nmethod:\\n˜E(θf, θy, θd) =\\nX\\ni=1..N\\ndi=0\\nLy\\n\\x00Gy(Gf(xi; θf); θy), yi\\n\\x01\\n+\\nX\\ni=1..N\\nLd\\n\\x00Gd(Rλ(Gf(xi; θf)); θd), yi\\n\\x01\\n(9)\\nRunning updates (4)-(6) can then be implemented as do-\\ning SGD for (9) and leads to the emergence of features\\nthat are domain-invariant and discriminative at the same\\ntime.\\nAfter the learning, the label predictor y(x) =\\nGy(Gf(x; θf); θy) can be used to predict labels for sam-\\nples from the target domain (as well as from the source\\ndomain).'),\n",

Relation to H∆H-distance\\nIn this section we give a brief analysis of our method in\\nterms of H∆H-distance (Ben-David et al., 2010; Cortes &\\nMohri, 2011) which is widely used in the theory of non-\\nconservative domain adaptation. Formally,\\ndH∆H(S, T ) = 2\\nsup\\nh1,h2∈H\\n|Pf∼S[h1(f) ̸= h2(f)]−\\n−Pf∼T [h1(f) ̸= h2(f)]|\\n(10)\\ndeﬁnes a discrepancy distance between two distributions S\\nand T w.r.t. a hypothesis set H. Using this notion one can\\nobtain a probabilistic bound (Ben-David et al., 2010) on the\\nperformance εT (h) of some classiﬁer h from T evaluated\\non the target domain given its performance εS(h) on the\\nsource domain:\\nεT (h) ≤εS(h) + 1\\n2dH∆H(S, T ) + C ,\\n(11)\\nwhere S and T are source and target distributions respec-\\ntively, and C does not depend on particular h.\\nConsider ﬁxed S and T over the representation space pro-\\nduced by the feature extractor Gf and a family of label\\npredictors Hp. We assume that the family of domain classi-\\nﬁers Hd is rich enough to contain the symmetric difference\\nhypothesis set of Hp:\\nHp∆Hp = {h | h = h1 ⊕h2 , h1, h2 ∈Hp} .\\n(12)\\nIt is not an unrealistic assumption as we have a freedom to\\npick Hd whichever we want. For example, we can set the\\narchitecture of the domain discriminator to be the layer-\\nby-layer concatenation of two replicas of the label predic-\\ntor followed by a two layer non-linear perceptron aimed to\\nlearn the XOR-function. Given the assumption holds, one\\ncan easily show that training the Gd is closely related to\\nthe estimation of dHp∆Hp(S, T ). Indeed,\\ndHp∆Hp(S, T ) =\\n= 2\\nsup\\nh∈Hp∆Hp\\n|Pf∼S[h(f) = 1] −Pf∼T [h(f) = 1]| ≤\\n≤2 sup\\nh∈Hd\\n|Pf∼S[h(f) = 1] −Pf∼T [h(f) = 1]| =\\n= 2 sup\\nh∈Hd\\n|1 −α(h)| = 2 sup\\nh∈Hd\\n[α(h) −1]\\n(13)\\nwhere α(h) = Pf∼S[h(f) = 0] + Pf∼T [h(f) = 1] is max-\\nimized by the optimal Gd.\\nThus, optimal discriminator gives the upper bound for\\ndHp∆Hp(S, T ).\\nAt the same time, backpropagation of\\nthe reversed gradient changes the representation space\\nso that α(Gd) becomes smaller effectively reducing\\ndHp∆Hp(S, T ) and leading to the better approximation of\\nεT (Gy) by εS(Gy).\\n4. Experiments\\nWe perform extensive evaluation of the proposed approach\\non a number of popular image datasets and their modiﬁ-\\ncations. These include large-scale datasets of small im-\\nages popular with deep learning methods, and the OFFICE\\ndatasets (Saenko et al., 2010), which are a de facto standard\\nfor domain adaptation in computer vision, but have much\\nfewer images.\\nBaselines. For the bulk of experiments the following base-\\nlines are evaluated. The source-only model is trained with-\\nout consideration for target-domain data (no domain clas-\\nsiﬁer branch included into the network).\\nThe train-on-\\ntarget model is trained on the target domain with class\\nlabels revealed. This model serves as an upper bound on\\nDA methods, assuming that target data are abundant and\\nthe shift between the domains is considerable.\\nIn addition, we compare our approach against the recently\\nproposed unsupervised DA method based on subspace\\nalignment (SA) (Fernando et al., 2013), which is simple\\nto setup and test on new datasets, but has also been shown\\nto perform very well in experimental comparisons with\\nother “shallow” DA methods. To boost the performance\\nof this baseline, we pick its most important free parame-\\nter (the number of principal components) from the range\\n{2, . . . , 60}, so that the test performance on the target do-\\nmain is maximized. To apply SA in our setting, we train\\na source-only model and then consider the activations of\\nthe last hidden layer in the label predictor (before the ﬁnal\\nlinear classiﬁer) as descriptors/features, and learn the map-\\nping between the source and the target domains (Fernando\\net al., 2013).\\nSince the SA baseline requires to train a new classiﬁer after\\nadapting the features, and in order to put all the compared\\nsettings on an equal footing, we retrain the last layer of\\nthe label predictor using a standard linear SVM (Fan et al.,\\n2008) for all four considered methods (including ours; the\\nperformance on the target domain remains approximately\\nthe same after the retraining).\\nFor the OFFICE dataset (Saenko et al., 2010), we directly\\ncompare the performance of our full network (feature ex-\\ntractor and label predictor) against recent DA approaches\\nusing previously published results.\\nCNN architectures. In general, we compose feature ex-\\ntractor from two or three convolutional layers, picking their\\nexact conﬁgurations from previous works. We give the ex-\\nact architectures in Appendix B.\\nFor the domain adaptator we stick to the three fully con-\\nnected layers (x →1024 →1024 →2), except for\\nMNIST where we used a simpler (x →100 →2) ar-'),\n",

The training procedure changes\\nslightly as the label predictor is now exposed to the tar-\\nget data. Figure 4 shows the change of the validation error\\nthroughout the training. While the graph clearly suggests\\nthat our method can be used in the semi-supervised setting,\\nthorough veriﬁcation of semi-supervised setting is left for\\nfuture work.\\nOfﬁce dataset. We ﬁnally evaluate our method on OF-\\nFICE dataset, which is a collection of three distinct do-\\nmains: AMAZON, DSLR, and WEBCAM. Unlike previ-\\nously discussed datasets, OFFICE is rather small-scale with\\nonly 2817 labeled images spread across 31 different cat-\\negories in the largest domain.\\nThe amount of available\\ndata is crucial for a successful training of a deep model,\\nhence we opted for the ﬁne-tuning of the CNN pre-trained\\non the ImageNet (Jia et al., 2014) as it is done in some re-\\ncent DA works (Donahue et al., 2014; Tzeng et al., 2014;\\nHoffman et al., 2013). We make our approach more com-\\nparable with (Tzeng et al., 2014) by using exactly the same\\nnetwork architecture replacing domain mean-based regu-\\nlarization with the domain classiﬁer.\\nFollowing most previous works, we evaluate our method\\nusing 5 random splits for each of the 3 transfer tasks com-\\nmonly used for evaluation. Our training protocol is close to\\n(Tzeng et al., 2014; Saenko et al., 2010; Gong et al., 2012)\\nas we use the same number of labeled source-domain im-\\nages per category. Unlike those works and similarly to e.g.\\nDLID (S. Chopra & Gopalan, 2013) we use the whole un-\\nlabeled target domain (as the premise of our method is the\\nabundance of unlabeled data in the target domain). Un-\\nder this transductive setting, our method is able to improve\\npreviously-reported state-of-the-art accuracy for unsuper-\\nvised adaptation very considerably (Table 2), especially in\\nthe most challenging AMAZON →WEBCAM scenario (the\\ntwo domains with the largest domain shift).\\n5. Discussion\\nWe have proposed a new approach to unsupervised do-\\nmain adaptation of deep feed-forward architectures, which\\nallows large-scale training based on large amount of an-\\nnotated data in the source domain and large amount of\\nunannotated data in the target domain. Similarly to many\\nprevious shallow and deep DA techniques, the adaptation\\nis achieved through aligning the distributions of features\\nacross the two domains.\\nHowever, unlike previous ap-\\nproaches, the alignment is accomplished through standard\\nbackpropagation training. The approach is therefore rather\\nscalable, and can be implemented using any deep learning\\npackage. To this end we plan to release the source code for\\nthe Gradient Reversal layer along with the usage examples\\nas an extension to Caffe (Jia et al., 2014).\\nFurther evaluation on larger-scale tasks and in semi-\\nsupervised settings constitutes future work. It is also in-\\nteresting whether the approach can beneﬁt from a good ini-\\ntialization of the feature extractor. For this, a natural choice\\nwould be to use deep autoencoder/deconvolution network\\ntrained on both domains (or on the target domain) in the\\nsame vein as (Glorot et al., 2011; S. Chopra & Gopalan,\\n2013), effectively using (Glorot et al., 2011; S. Chopra &\\nGopalan, 2013) as an initialization to our method.'),\n",

An alternative optimization\\napproach\\nThere exists an alternative construction (inspired by (Good-\\nfellow et al., 2014)) that leads to the same updates (4)-(6).\\nRather than using the gradient reversal layer, the construc-\\ntion introduces two different loss functions for the domain\\nclassiﬁer.\\nMinimization of the ﬁrst domain loss (Ld+)\\nshould lead to a better domain discrimination, while the\\nsecond domain loss (Ld−) is minimized when the domains\\nare distinct.

However, other pairs of loss functions can be\\nused. One example would be the binomial cross-entropy\\n(Goodfellow et al., 2014):\\nLd+(q, d) =\\nX\\ni=1..N\\ndi log(qi) + (1 −di) log(1 −qi) ,\\nwhere d indicates domain indices and q is an output of the\\npredictor. In that case “adversarial” loss is easily obtained\\nby swapping domain labels, i.e. Ld−(q, d) = Ld+(q, 1−d).\\nThis particular pair has a potential advantage of produc-\\ning stronger gradients at early learning stages if the do-\\nmains are quite dissimilar. In our experiments, however,\\nwe did not observe any signiﬁcant improvement resulting\\nfrom this choice of losses.\\nAppendix B.

Introduction\\nConsider a group of robots trained by the manufacturer\\nto recognize thousands of common objects using standard\\nimage databases, then shipped to households around the\\ncountry. As each robot starts to operate in its own unique\\nenvironment, it is likely to have degraded performance due\\nto the shift in domain. It is clear that, given enough ex-\\ntra supervised data from the new environment, the original\\nperformance could be recovered. However, state-of-the-art\\nrecognition algorithms rely on high capacity convolutional\\nneural network (CNN) models that require millions of su-\\npervised images for initial training. Even the traditional\\napproach for adapting deep models, ﬁne-tuning [14, 29],\\nmay require hundreds or thousands of labeled examples for\\neach object category that needs to be adapted.\\nIt is reasonable to assume that the robot’s new owner\\nwill label a handful of examples for a few types of objects,\\nbut completely unrealistic to presume full supervision in\\nthe new environment. Therefore, we propose an algorithm\\nthat effectively adapts between the training (source) and test\\n(target) environments by utilizing both generic statistics from\\n∗Authors contributed equally.\\n!\\n!\\nBottleMug\\nChair\\nLaptop\\nKeyboard\\nBottleMug\\nChair\\nLaptop\\nKeyboard\\n!\\n!\\nSource domain!\\nTarget domain!\\n!\\n!\\n!\\n !\\n!\\n !\\n!\\n !\\n!\\n !\\n1.

Dataset bias was classi-\\ncally illustrated in computer vision by the “name the dataset”\\ngame of Torralba and Efros [31], which trained a classiﬁer\\nto predict which dataset an image originates from, thereby\\nshowing that visual datasets are biased samples of the visual\\nworld. Indeed, this turns out to be formally connected to\\nmeasures of domain discrepancy [21, 5]. Optimizing for\\ndomain invariance, therefore, can be considered equivalent\\nto the task of learning to predict the class labels while simul-\\ntaneously ﬁnding a representation that makes the domains\\nappear as similar as possible. This principle forms the do-\\nmain transfer component of our proposed approach. We\\nlearn deep representations by optimizing over a loss which\\nincludes both classiﬁcation error on the labeled data as well\\nas a domain confusion loss which seeks to make the domains\\nindistinguishable.\\nHowever, while maximizing domain confusion pulls the\\nmarginal distributions of the domains together, it does not\\nnecessarily align the classes in the target with those in the\\nsource. Thus, we also explicitly transfer the similarity struc-\\nture amongst categories from the source to the target and\\nfurther optimize our representation to produce the same struc-\\nture in the target domain using the few target labeled exam-\\nples as reference points. We are inspired by prior work on\\ndistilling deep models [3, 16] and extend the ideas presented\\nin these works to a domain adaptation setting. We ﬁrst com-\\npute the average output probability distribution, or “soft\\nlabel,” over the source training examples in each category.\\nThen, for each target labeled example, we directly optimize\\nour model to match the distribution over classes to the soft\\nlabel. In this way we are able to perform task adaptation by\\ntransferring information to categories with no explicit labels\\nin the target domain.\\nWe solve the two problems jointly using a new CNN ar-\\nchitecture, outlined in Figure 2. We combine a domain con-\\nfusion and softmax cross-entropy losses to train the network\\nwith the target data. Our architecture can be used to solve su-\\npervised adaptation, when a small amount of target labeled\\ndata is available from each category, and semi-supervised\\nadaptation, when a small amount of target labeled data is\\navailable from a subset of the categories. We provide a com-\\nprehensive evaluation on the popular Ofﬁce benchmark [28]\\nand the recently introduced cross-dataset collection [30] for\\nclassiﬁcation across visually distinct domains. We demon-\\nstrate that by jointly optimizing for domain confusion and\\nmatching soft labels, we are able to outperform the current\\nstate-of-the-art visual domain adaptation results.\\n2. Related work\\nThere have been many approaches proposed in recent\\nyears to solve the visual domain adaptation problem, which\\nis also commonly framed as the visual dataset bias prob-\\nlem [31]. All recognize that there is a shift in the distri-\\nbution of the source and target data representations. In\\nfact, the size of a domain shift is often measured by the\\ndistance between the source and target subspace representa-\\ntions [5, 11, 21, 25, 27]. A large number of methods have\\nsought to overcome this difference by learning a feature\\nspace transformation to align the source and target repre-\\nsentations [28, 23, 11, 15]. For the supervised adaptation\\nscenario, when a limited amount of labeled data is available\\nin the target domain, some approaches have been proposed\\nto learn a target classiﬁer regularized against the source clas-\\nsiﬁer [32, 2, 1]. Others have sought to both learn a feature\\ntransformation and regularize a target classiﬁer simultane-\\nously [18, 10].\\nRecently, supervised CNN based feature representations\\nhave been shown to be extremely effective for a variety of\\nvisual recognition tasks [22, 9, 14, 29]. In particular, using\\ndeep representations dramatically reduces the effect of reso-\\nlution and lighting on domain shifts [9, 19]. Parallel CNN\\narchitectures such as Siamese networks have been shown\\nto be effective for learning invariant representations [6, 8].\\nHowever, training these networks requires labels for each\\ntraining instance, so it is unclear how to extend these meth-\\nods to unsupervised or semi-supervised settings. Multimodal\\ndeep learning architectures have also been explored to learn\\nrepresentations that are invariant to different input modal-\\nities [26]. However, this method operated primarily in a\\ngenerative context and therefore did not leverage the full\\nrepresentational power of supervised CNN representations.\\nTraining a joint source and target CNN architecture was\\nproposed by [7], but was limited to two layers and so was\\nsigniﬁcantly outperformed by the methods which used a\\ndeeper architecture [22], pre-trained on a large auxiliary\\ndata source (ex: ImageNet [4]).

Our overall CNN architecture for domain and task transfer. We use a domain confusion loss over all source and target (both labeled\\nand unlabeled) data to learn a domain invariant representation. We simultaneously transfer the learned source semantic structure to the target\\ndomain by optimizing the network to produce activation distributions that match those learned for source data in the source only CNN. Best\\nviewed in color.\\n3. Joint CNN architecture for domain and task\\ntransfer\\nWe ﬁrst give an overview of our convolutional network\\n(CNN) architecture, depicted in Figure 2, that learns a rep-\\nresentation which both aligns visual domains and transfers\\nthe semantic structure from a well labeled source domain to\\nthe sparsely labeled target domain. We assume access to a\\nlimited amount of labeled target data, potentially from only\\na subset of the categories of interest. With limited labels on\\na subset of the categories, the traditional domain transfer ap-\\nproach of ﬁne-tuning on the available target data [14, 29, 17]\\nis not effective. Instead, since the source labeled data shares\\nthe label space of our target domain, we use the source data\\nto guide training of the corresponding classiﬁers.\\nOur method takes as input the labeled source data\\n{xS, yS} (blue box Figure 2) and the target data {xT , yT }\\n(green box Figure 2), where the labels yT are only provided\\nfor a subset of the target examples. Our goal is to produce\\na category classiﬁer θC that operates on an image feature\\nrepresentation f(x; θrepr) parameterized by representation\\nparameters θrepr and can correctly classify target examples\\nat test time.\\nFor a setting with K categories, let our desired classiﬁca-\\ntion objective be deﬁned as the standard softmax loss\\nLC(x, y; θrepr, θC) = −\\nX\\nk\\n1[y = k] log pk\\n(1)\\nwhere p is the softmax of the classiﬁer activations,\\np = softmax(θT\\nCf(x; θrepr)).\\nWe could use the available source labeled data to train\\nour representation and classiﬁer parameters according to\\nEquation (1), but this often leads to overﬁtting to the source\\ndistribution, causing reduced performance at test time when\\nrecognizing in the target domain. However, we note that\\nif the source and target domains are very similar then the\\nclassiﬁer trained on the source will perform well on the\\ntarget. In fact, it is sufﬁcient for the source and target data to\\nbe similar under the learned representation, θrepr.\\nInspired by the “name the dataset” game of Torralba\\nand Efros [31], we can directly train a domain classiﬁer\\nθD to identify whether a training example originates from\\nthe source or target domain given its feature representation.\\nIntuitively, if our choice of representation suffers from do-\\nmain shift, then they will lie in distinct parts of the feature\\nspace, and a classiﬁer will be able to easily separate the\\ndomains. We use this notion to add a new domain confusion\\nloss Lconf(xS, xT , θD; θrepr) to our objective and directly op-\\ntimize our representation so as to minimize the discrepancy\\nbetween the source and target distributions. This loss is\\ndescribed in more detail in Section 3.1.\\nDomain confusion can be applied to learn a representation\\nthat aligns source and target data without any target labeled\\ndata. However, we also presume a handful of sparse labels\\nin the target domain, yT . In this setting, a simple approach is\\nto incorporate the target labeled data along with the source\\nlabeled data into the classiﬁcation objective of Equation (1)1.\\nHowever, ﬁne-tuning with hard category labels limits the\\nimpact of a single training example, making it hard for the\\nnetwork to learn to generalize from the limited labeled data.\\nAdditionally, ﬁne-tuning with hard labels is ineffective when\\nlabeled data is available for only a subset of the categories.\\nFor our approach, we draw inspiration from recent net-\\nwork distillation works [3, 16], which demonstrate that a\\nlarge network can be “distilled” into a simpler model by re-\\nplacing the hard labels with the softmax activations from the\\noriginal large model.

In essence, because each train-\\ning example is paired with an output distribution, it provides\\nvaluable information about not only the category it belongs\\nto, but also each other category the classiﬁer is trained to\\nrecognize.\\nThus, we propose using the labeled target data to op-\\ntimize the network parameters through a soft label loss,\\nLsoft(xT , yT ; θrepr, θC). This loss will train the network pa-\\nrameters to produce a “soft label” activation that matches\\nthe average output distribution of source examples on a net-\\nwork trained to classify source data. This loss is described in\\nmore detail in Section 3.2. By training the network to match\\nthe expected source output distributions on target data, we\\ntransfer the learned inter-class correlations from the source\\ndomain to examples in the target domain. This directly trans-\\nfers useful information from source to target, such as the fact\\nthat bookshelves appear more similar to ﬁling cabinets than\\nto bicycles.\\nOur full method then minimizes the joint loss function\\nL(xS, yS, xT , yT , θD;θrepr, θC) =\\nLC(xS, yS, xT , yT ; θrepr, θC)\\n+ λLconf(xS, xT , θD; θrepr)\\n+ νLsoft(xT , yT ; θrepr, θC).\\n(2)\\nwhere the hyperparameters λ and ν determine how strongly\\ndomain confusion and soft labels inﬂuence the optimization.\\nOur ideas of domain confusion and soft label loss for task\\ntransfer are generic and can be applied to any CNN classiﬁ-\\ncation architecture. For our experiments and for the detailed\\ndiscussion in this paper we modify the standard Krizhevsky\\narchitecture [22], which has ﬁve convolutional layers (conv1–\\nconv5) and three fully connected layers (fc6–fc8). The rep-\\nresentation parameter θrepr corresponds to layers 1–7 of the\\nnetwork, and the classiﬁcation parameter θC corresponds to\\nlayer 8. For the remainder of this section, we provide further\\ndetails on our novel loss deﬁnitions and the implementation\\nof our model.\\n3.1. Aligning domains via domain confusion\\nIn this section we describe in detail our proposed domain\\nconfusion loss objective. Recall that we introduce the domain\\nconfusion loss as a means to learn a representation that is\\ndomain invariant, and thus will allow us to better utilize a\\nclassiﬁer trained using the labeled source data. We consider\\na representation to be domain invariant if a classiﬁer trained\\nusing that representation can not distinguish examples from\\nthe two domains.\\nTo this end, we add an additional domain classiﬁcation\\nlayer, denoted as fcD in Figure 2, with parameters θD. This\\nlayer simply performs binary classiﬁcation using the domain\\ncorresponding to an image as its label. For a particular fea-\\nture representation, θrepr, we evaluate its domain invariance\\nby learning the best domain classiﬁer on the representation.\\nThis can be learned by optimizing the following objective,\\nwhere yD denotes the domain that the example is drawn\\nfrom:\\nLD(xS, xT , θrepr; θD) = −\\nX\\nd\\n1[yD = d] log qd\\n(3)\\nwith q corresponding to the softmax of the domain classiﬁer\\nactivation: q = softmax(θT\\nDf(x; θrepr)).\\nFor a particular domain classiﬁer, θD, we can now in-\\ntroduce our loss which seeks to “maximally confuse” the\\ntwo domains by computing the cross entropy between the\\noutput predicted domain labels and a uniform distribution\\nover domain labels:\\nLconf(xS, xT , θD; θrepr) = −\\nX\\nd\\n1\\nD log qd.\\n(4)\\nThis domain confusion loss seeks to learn domain invari-\\nance by ﬁnding a representation in which the best domain\\nclassiﬁer performs poorly.\\nIdeally, we want to simultaneously minimize Equa-\\ntions (3) and (4) for the representation and the domain clas-\\nsiﬁer parameters. However, the two losses stand in direct\\nopposition to one another: learning a fully domain invariant\\nrepresentation means the domain classiﬁer must do poorly,\\nand learning an effective domain classiﬁer means that the\\nrepresentation is not domain invariant. Rather than globally\\noptimizing θD and θrepr, we instead perform iterative updates\\nfor the following two objectives given the ﬁxed parameters\\nfrom the previous iteration:\\nmin\\nθD LD(xS, xT , θrepr; θD)\\n(5)\\nmin\\nθrepr Lconf(xS, xT , θD; θrepr).\\n(6)\\nThese losses are readily implemented in standard deep\\nlearning frameworks, and after setting learning rates properly\\nso that Equation (5) only updates θD and Equation (6) only\\nupdates θrepr, the updates can be performed via standard\\nbackpropagation. Together, these updates ensure that we\\nlearn a representation that is domain invariant.\\n3.2. Aligning source and target classes via soft labels\\nWhile training the network to confuse the domains acts\\nto align their marginal distributions, there are no guarantees\\nabout the alignment of classes between each domain. To\\nensure that the relationships between classes are preserved\\nacross source and target, we ﬁne-tune the network against\\n“soft labels” rather than the image category hard label.\\nWe deﬁne a soft label for category k as the average over\\nthe softmax of all activations of source examples in category\\nk, depicted graphically in Figure 3, and denote this aver-\\nage as l(k).

Instead, we use a\\nsoftmax with a high temperature τ so that the related classes\\nhave enough probability mass to have an effect during ﬁne-\\ntuning.

The soft label l(bottle) is\\na K-dimensional vector, where each dimension indicates\\nthe similarity of bottles to each of the K categories. In this\\nexample, the bottle soft label will have a higher weight on\\nmug than on keyboard, since bottles and mugs are more\\nvisually similar. Thus, soft label training with this particular\\nsoft label directly enforces the relationship that bottles and\\nmugs should be closer in feature space than bottles and\\nkeyboards.\\nOne important beneﬁt of using this soft label loss is that\\nwe ensure that the parameters for categories without any\\nlabeled target data are still updated to output non-zero proba-\\nbilities. We explore this beneﬁt in Section 4, where we train\\na network using labels from a subset of the target categories\\nand ﬁnd signiﬁcant performance improvement even when\\nevaluating only on the unlabeled categories.\\n4.

Adaptation on the Ofﬁce dataset\\nThe Ofﬁce dataset is a collection of images from three\\ndistinct domains, Amazon, DSLR, and Webcam, the largest\\nof which has 2817 labeled images [28]. The 31 categories\\nin the dataset consist of objects commonly encountered in\\nofﬁce settings, such as keyboards, ﬁle cabinets, and laptops.\\nWe evaluate our method in two different settings:\\n• Supervised adaptation Labeled training data for all\\ncategories is available in source and sparsely in target.\\n• Semi-supervised adaptation (task adaptation) La-\\nbeled training data is available in source and sparsely\\nfor a subset of the target categories.\\nFor all experiments we initialize the parameters of conv1–\\nfc7 using the released CaffeNet [20] weights. We then fur-\\nther ﬁne-tune the network using the source labeled data in or-\\nder to produce the soft label distributions and use the learned\\nsource CNN weights as the initial parameters for training\\nour method. All implementations are produced using the\\nopen source Caffe [20] framework, and the network deﬁni-\\ntion ﬁles and cross entropy loss layer needed for training\\nwill be released upon acceptance. We optimize the network\\nusing a learning rate of 0.001 and set the hyper-parameters\\nto λ = 0.01 (confusion) and ν = 0.1 (soft).\\nFor each of the six domain shifts, we evaluate across ﬁve\\ntrain/test splits, which are generated by sampling examples\\nfrom the full set of images per domain.

No labeled target monitors were available during\\ntraining; however, as shown in the upper right corner of Fig-\\nure 8, the soft labels for laptop computer was present during\\ntraining and assigns a relatively high weight to the monitor\\nclass. Soft label ﬁne-tuning thus allows us to exploit the fact\\nthat these categories are similar.

Identifying the veracity of a news article is an interesting\\nproblem while automating this process can be a challenging task.

We present a novel idea\\nthat combines the neural, statistical and external features to provide\\nan eﬃcient solution to this problem. We compute the neural embedding\\nfrom the deep recurrent model, statistical features from the weighted\\nn-gram bag-of-words model and hand crafted external features with the\\nhelp of feature engineering heuristics. Finally, using deep neural layer all\\nthe features are combined, thereby classifying the headline-body news\\npair as agree, disagree, discuss, or unrelated.

Headline-body pairs along with their relative stance.\\nThe root cause of this problem lies in the fact that none of the social net-\\nworking sites use any automatic system that can identify the veracity of news\\nﬂowing across these platforms. A possible reason for this failure is the open do-\\nmain nature of the problem that adds to the intricacies. The recently organized\\nFake News Challenge (FNC-1) [13] is an initiative in this direction. The aim of\\nthis challenge is to build an automatic system that has the capability to iden-\\ntify whether a news article is fake or not. More speciﬁcally, given a news article\\nthe task is to evaluate the relatedness of the news body towards its headline.\\nThe relatedness or stance is the relative perspective of a news article towards a\\nrelative claim (shown in Table 1).\\nThe idea behind building a countermeasure for fake news is to use machine\\nlearning and natural language processing (NLP) tools that can compute semantic\\nand contextual similarity between the headline and the body, and classify the\\npairs into one of four categories. Deep learning models have been eﬃcacious in\\nsolving many NLP problems that share similarities to fake news which includes\\nbut not limited to - computing semantic similarity between sentences [1, 18],\\ncommunity based question answering [31, 32], etc. The basic building blocks\\nof all deep models are recurrent networks such as recurrent neural networks\\n(RNN) [23], long short-term memory networks (LSTM) [16] and gated recurrent\\nunits (GRU) [11], and convolution networks such as convolution neural networks\\n(CNN) [17]. A deep architecture encodes the given sequence of words into ﬁxed\\nlength vector representation which can be used to score the relevance of two\\ntextual entities, in our case, relevance of each headline-body pair.\\nStatistical information related to text can be encoded to vectors using the\\ntraditional bag-of-words (BOW) approach. The BOW approaches are often com-\\nbined with term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF), and n-\\ngrams that helps to encode more information related to the text [28, 12]. These\\napproaches, however simple, have been used to ameliorate the performance of\\ndeep models in complex NLP problems such as community question answering\\n[32] and answer sentence selection [33]. Sometimes, it is beneﬁcial to leverage\\nfeature engineering heuristics when combined with statistical approaches. The\\nfeature engineering heuristics or the external features are used to aid the learn-\\ning model to successfully converge to a global solution [31, 32, 34]. The external\\nfeatures includes common observations such as number of n-grams, number of\\nwords match between headline and the body, cosine similarity between the head-\\nline and the body vector, etc. The FNC-1 baseline also includes a combination\\nof feature engineering heuristics that alone achieves a competitive performance,\\neven outperforming several widely used deep learning architectures.

In our work, instead of using the models separately,\\nwe combine the best of these models.\\nAnother team, [34], combined multiple models in an ensemble providing\\n50/50 weighted average between deep convolution neural network and a gradient-\\nboosted decision trees. Though this work seems to be similar to our work, the\\ndiﬀerence lies in the construction of ensemble of classiﬁers. In a similar attempt,\\na team [2] concatenated various features vectors and passed it through an MLP\\nmodel.\\nThe work by [28], focuses on generating lexical and similarity features using\\n(TF-IDF) representations of bag-of-words (BOW) which are then fed through\\na multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer. In their work, [6] di-\\nvided the problem into two groups: unrelated and related. They were able to\\nachieve 90% accuracy on the related/unrelated task by ﬁnding maximum and\\naverage Jaccard similarity score across all sentences in the article and choosing\\nappropriate threshold values. A similar work of splitting the problem into two\\nsubproblems (related and unrelated) is also performed by [10]. The work by [22]\\nfocuses on the use of recurrent models for fake news stance detection.\\n3\\nTechnique Used\\n3.1\\nDeep Learning Architectures\\nTo predict the stance for a given sample in FNC-1 dataset, a multi-channel\\ndeep neural network can be used to encode a given headline-body pair, which\\ncan be classiﬁed into one of the four stances. This is achieved by using a multi\\nchannel convolution neural network with softmax layer at the output (shown in\\nFigure 1). Similarly, instead of using the convolution and pooling layers, LSTM\\nand GRU can be used to encode the headline-body pairs. The LSTMs and GRUs\\nencode the given sequence of words into ﬁxed length vector representation which\\ncan be used to score the relevance of headline-body pair. However, for long\\nsequences, such as the body of a news article (which typically contain hundreds\\nof words), the RNN models fail to completely encode the entire information\\ninto a ﬁxed length vector. A solution to this problem is given in the form of\\nattentional mechanism [9] which computes a weighted sum of all the encoder\\nunits that are passed on to the decoder. The decoder is learned in such a way\\nthat it gives importance to only some of the words. The attention mechanism\\nalso alleviates the bottleneck of encoding input sequences to ﬁxed length vector\\nand have been shown to outperform other RNN based encoder-decoder models\\non longer sequences [4]. To alleviate the problem of limited memory we use\\nattention mechanism as described in [4].\\nWe experiment with some of the deep architectures that have been shown to\\nbe successful in NLP tasks (shown in Figure 1). Most of these architectures have\\nbeen proven to be eﬀective for non-factoid based question answering [30, 14].'),\n",

Deep architectures used for stance detection on the FNC-1 dataset.\\n4\\nProposed Idea\\nThe unrelated headline-body pairs in the FNC-1 dataset are created by ran-\\ndomly assigning a news body to the given headline. This type of data augmen-\\ntation has been successfully used in NLP problems such as non-factoid question\\nanswering where it results in reasonable performance by the deep learning mod-\\nels [31, 19]. However, in the case of FNC-1 challenge, the agree, disagree, and\\ndiscuss headline-body pairs are relatively smaller in quantity than the unrelated\\nstance. This bias leads to a uneven distribution of dataset across the four classes,\\nwith the unrelated category being the least interesting. Interestingness of a\\nheadline-body pair is evaluated in terms of information that it contains; It is\\neasier to evaluate a unrelated pair, while the other three are contingent on\\nexploring contextual relationship between the headline and its body, and are\\nconsidered more interesting.\\nThe uneven distribution of FNC-1 dataset thwarts the performance of deep\\nlearning architectures introduced in Section 3. Moreover, news articles are heav-\\nily inﬂuenced by some words that are generally associated with news to describe\\nits polarity. For example, words like crime, accident, and scandal are often used\\nwith negative connotation. If such words are present in both the news headline,\\nor are present in one while absent from the other, then, it is easier to identify such\\na pair as agree or disagree. Deep learning models are dependent on a huge train-\\ning corpus (few million headline-body pairs) in order to identify such nuances\\nin patterns. The FNC-1 dataset, though the largest publicly available dataset\\non stance detection, does not satiate this criteria. For this reason, we introduce\\na much simpler strategy that consists of heavy use of feature engineering. We\\nleveraged several widely used state-of-the-art features used in natural language\\nprocessing, and use a feed-forward deep neural network which aggregates all the\\nindividual features and computes a score for each headline-body pair.'),\n",

In\\nour work, we use the pre-trained skip-thought embedding which is trained on\\nBookCorpus [35]. We make the use of a pre-trained model since the FNC-1\\ndataset is relatively smaller than the dataset required to eﬃciently train a re-\\ncurrent encoder-decoder model like skip-thought.\\nWe follow the work of [18, 1] and compute two features from the skip-thought\\nembeddings. These features have been shown to be eﬀective in evaluating con-\\ntextual similarity between sentences. The task of stance detection is analogous\\nto the computation of contextual similarity between two sentences - headline\\nand its body. We speculate that the features introduced by [18, 1] should be\\neﬀective for stance detection as well. Given the skip-thought encoding of news\\nand headline as unews and vhead, we compute two features\\nfeat1 = unews.vhead\\n(1)\\nfeat2 = |unews −vhead|\\n(2)\\nwhere feat1 is the component-wise product and feat2 is the absolute diﬀer-\\nence between the skip-thought encoding of news and headlines.

Recognizing this data bias and the simpler na-\\nture of the related/unrelated classiﬁcation problems, the organizers of FNC-1\\nintroduced the following weighted accuracy score as their ﬁnal evaluation metric.\\nScore1 = AccuracyRelated,Unrelated\\n(3)\\nScore2 = AccuracyAgree,Disagree,Discuss\\n(4)\\nScoreF NC = 0.25 ∗Score1 + 0.75 ∗Score2\\n(5)\\nWe use the ScoreF NC as the main evaluation criteria while comparing the\\nproposed model with other related techniques. We also use the class-wise accu-\\nracy for further evaluation of the performance of all the techniques.\\n5.5\\nResults\\nThe results on FNC-1 test dataset are shown in Table 4. The ﬁrst part of the ta-\\nble shows the performance of the baselines used in our work. The FNC-1 baseline\\nachieves a score of 75.2 which is better than the performance of all deep archi-\\ntectures introduced in Section 3. The FNC-1 baseline is comprised of training\\ngradient tree classiﬁer on the hand crafted features (described in Section 4.3).\\nProvided the simplicity of this baseline, it is indeed remarkable to achieve such a\\nhigh score. The FNC-1 baselines achieves approx 7% higher class-wise accuracy\\non unrelated stance as compared to skip-thought baseline, whereas the latter\\nreceiving a higher ScoreF NC. Skip-thought baselines achieves a higher accuracy\\non agree and discuss than the unrelated stance. Since the interestingness of\\nagree and discuss is higher than the unrealted stance, therefore, skip-thought\\nachieves a higher ScoreF NC. This also explains the reason for the introduction\\nof new scoring criterion by the FNC organizers (see Section 5.4). Finally, the\\nScoreF NC by skip-thought, external features, and TF-IDF baselines are higher\\nthan the FNC-1 baseline. Therefore, our speculation to combine these three base-\\nlines models, is guaranteed to achieve a higher score on ScoreF NC evaluation\\nmetric. Moreover, all the baselines achieves very low or zero score on the dis-\\nagree stance. Therefore, apart from the ScoreF NC, the class-wise performance\\nis worth considering as a performance criterion.\\nThe performance of top-4 teams that participated in FNC-1 are shown in the\\nmiddle part of Table 4, with SOLAT in the SWEN [34] winning the challenge\\nachieving a score of 82.05. All the teams achieved higher score and class-wise\\naccuracy on all stances except for the disagree stance. This should be a concern,\\nsince the importance of disagree is equivalent to the agree and discuss stance.\\nWe observed that the news pairs in the disagree category are not only very few,\\nbut also consists of divergent news articles. This is one of the reason for poor\\nperformance of most of the deep models, including the top teams, on identifying\\ndiagree stance.'),\n",

It underlies most aspects of modern business, including such critical areas as\\ninventory control and customer management, as well as business planning going from production and\\ndistribution to ﬁnance and marketing. As such, it has a considerable ﬁnancial impact, often ranging\\nin the millions of dollars for every point of forecasting accuracy gained (Jain, 2017; Kahn, 2003).\\nAnd yet, unlike areas such as computer vision or natural language processing where deep learning\\n(DL) techniques are now well entrenched, there still exists evidence that ML and DL struggle to\\noutperform classical statistical TS forecasting approaches (Makridakis et al., 2018a;b). For instance,\\nthe rankings of the six “pure” ML methods submitted to M4 competition were 23, 37, 38, 48, 54,\\nand 57 out of a total of 60 entries, and most of the best-ranking methods were ensembles of classical\\nstatistical techniques (Makridakis et al., 2018b).\\nOn the other hand, the M4 competition winner (Smyl, 2020), was based on a hybrid between\\nneural residual/attention dilated LSTM stack with a classical Holt-Winters statistical model (Holt,\\n1957; 2004; Winters, 1960) with learnable parameters. Since Smyl’s approach heavily depends on\\nthis Holt-Winters component, Makridakis et al. (2018b) further argue that “hybrid approaches and\\ncombinations of method are the way forward for improving the forecasting accuracy and making\\nforecasting more valuable”. In this work we aspire to challenge this conclusion by exploring the\\npotential of pure DL architectures in the context of the TS forecasting. Moreover, in the context of\\ninterpretable DL architecture design, we are interested in answering the following question: can we\\n1\\narXiv:1905.10437v4  [cs.LG]  20 Feb 2020'),\n",

In our view, this\\nprovides a long-missing proof of concept for the use of pure ML in TS forecasting and strengthens\\nmotivation to continue advancing the research in this area.\\nInterpretable DL for Time Series: In addition to accuracy beneﬁts, we also show that it is fea-\\nsible to design an architecture with interpretable outputs that can be used by practitioners in very\\nmuch the same way as traditional decomposition techniques such as the “seasonality-trend-level”\\napproach (Cleveland et al., 1990).\\n2\\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\\nWe consider the univariate point forecasting problem in discrete time. Given a length-H forecast\\nhorizon a length-T observed series history [y1,...,yT] ∈RT, the task is to predict the vector of\\nfuture values y ∈RH = [yT+1,yT+2,...,yT+H]. For simplicity, we will later consider a lookback\\nwindow of length t ≤T ending with the last observed value yT to serve as model input, and denoted\\nx ∈Rt = [yT−t+1,...,yT]. We denote by the forecast of y. The following metrics are commonly\\nused to evaluate forecasting performance (Hyndman & Koehler, 2006; Makridakis & Hibon, 2000;\\nMakridakis et al., 2018b; Athanasopoulos et al., 2011):\\nsMAPE = 200\\nH\\nH\\n∑\\ni=1\\n|yT+i −byT+i|\\n|yT+i|+|byT+i|,\\nMAPE = 100\\nH\\nH\\n∑\\ni=1\\n|yT+i −byT+i|\\n|yT+i|\\n,\\nMASE = 1\\nH\\nH\\n∑\\ni=1\\n|yT+i −byT+i|\\n1\\nT+H−m ∑T+H\\nj=m+1 |y j −yj−m|,\\nOWA = 1\\n2\\n\\x14\\nsMAPE\\nsMAPENaïve2\\n+\\nMASE\\nMASENaïve2\\n\\x15\\n.\\nHere m is the periodicity of the data (e.g., 12 for monthly series). MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage\\nError), sMAPE (symmetric MAPE) and MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error) are standard scale-free\\nmetrics in the practice of forecasting (Hyndman & Koehler, 2006; Makridakis & Hibon, 2000):\\nwhereas sMAPE scales the error by the average between the forecast and ground truth, the MASE\\nscales by the average error of the naïve predictor that simply copies the observation measured m\\nperiods in the past, thereby accounting for seasonality. OWA (overall weighted average) is a M4-\\nspeciﬁc metric used to rank competition entries (M4 Team, 2018b), where sMAPE and MASE metrics\\nare normalized such that a seasonally-adjusted naïve forecast obtains OWA = 1.0.\\n3\\nN-BEATS\\nOur architecture design methodology relies on a few key principles. First, the base architecture\\nshould be simple and generic, yet expressive (deep). Second, the architecture should not rely on time-\\nseries-speciﬁc feature engineering or input scaling. These prerequisites let us explore the potential\\nof pure DL architecture in TS forecasting. Finally, as a prerequisite to explore interpretability, the\\narchitecture should be extendable towards making its outputs human interpretable. We now discuss\\nhow those principles converge to the proposed architecture.\\n3.1\\nBASIC BLOCK\\nThe proposed basic building block has a fork architecture and is depicted in Fig. 1 (left). We focus on\\ndescribing the operation of ℓ-th block in this section in detail (note that the block index ℓis dropped\\nin Fig. 1 for brevity). The ℓ-th block accepts its respective input xℓand outputs two vectors, bxℓand\\nbyℓ. For the very ﬁrst block in the model, its respective xℓis the overall model input — a history\\nlookback window of certain length ending with the last measured observation.

For the rest of the blocks, their inputs xℓare residual outputs of the previous blocks. Each\\nblock has two outputs: byℓ, the block’s forward forecast of length H; and bxℓ, the block’s best estimate\\nof xℓ, also known as the ‘backcast’, given the constraints on the functional space that the block can\\nuse to approximate signals.\\nInternally, the basic building block consists of two parts. The ﬁrst part is a fully connected network\\nthat produces the forward θ f\\nℓand the backward θ b\\nℓpredictors of expansion coefﬁcients (again, note\\nthat the block index ℓis dropped for θ b\\nℓ, θ f\\nℓ, gb\\nℓ, gf\\nℓin Fig. 1 for brevity). The second part consists of\\nthe backward gb\\nℓand the forward gf\\nℓbasis layers that accept the respective forward θ f\\nℓand backward\\nθ b\\nℓexpansion coefﬁcients, project them internally on the set of basis functions and produce the\\nbackcast bxℓand the forecast outputs byℓdeﬁned in the previous paragraph.\\nThe operation of the ﬁrst part of the ℓ-th block is described by the following equations:\\nhℓ,1 = FCℓ,1(xℓ),\\nhℓ,2 = FCℓ,2(hℓ,1),\\nhℓ,3 = FCℓ,3(hℓ,2),\\nhℓ,4 = FCℓ,4(hℓ,3).\\nθ b\\nℓ= LINEARb\\nℓ(hℓ,4),\\nθ f\\nℓ= LINEAR f\\nℓ(hℓ,4).\\n(1)\\nHere LINEAR layer is simply a linear projection layer, i.e. θ f\\nℓ= W f\\nℓhℓ,4. The FC layer is a standard\\nfully connected layer with RELU non-linearity (Nair & Hinton, 2010), such that for FCℓ,1 we have,\\nfor example: hℓ,1 = RELU(Wℓ,1xℓ+bℓ,1). One task of this part of the architecture is to predict the\\nforward expansion coefﬁcients θ f\\nℓwith the ultimate goal of optimizing the accuracy of the partial\\nforecast byℓby properly mixing the basis vectors supplied by gf\\nℓ.

The DenseNet architecture proposed by Huang\\net al. (2017) extends this principle by introducing extra connections from the output of each stack to\\nthe input of every other stack that follows it. These approaches provide clear advantages in improving\\nthe trainability of deep architectures. Their disadvantage in the context of this work is that they result\\nin network structures that are difﬁcult to interpret. We propose a novel hierarchical doubly residual\\ntopology depicted in Fig. 1 (middle and right). The proposed architecture has two residual branches,\\none running over backcast prediction of each layer and the other one is running over the forecast\\nbranch of each layer. Its operation is described by the following equations:\\nxℓ= xℓ−1 −bxℓ−1,\\nby = ∑\\nℓ\\nbyℓ.\\nAs previously mentioned, in the special case of the very ﬁrst block, its input is the model level\\ninput x, x1 ≡x. For all other blocks, the backcast residual branch xℓcan be thought of as running a\\nsequential analysis of the input signal. Previous block removes the portion of the signal bxℓ−1 that\\nit can approximate well, making the forecast job of the downstream blocks easier. This structure\\nalso facilitates more ﬂuid gradient backpropagation. More importantly, each block outputs a partial\\nforecast byℓthat is ﬁrst aggregated at the stack level and then at the overall network level, providing a\\nhierarchical decomposition. The ﬁnal forecast by is the sum of all partial forecasts. In a generic model\\ncontext, when stacks are allowed to have arbitrary gb\\nℓand gf\\nℓfor each layer, this makes the network\\nmore transparent to gradient ﬂows. In a special situation of deliberate structure enforced in gb\\nℓand gf\\nℓ\\nshared over a stack, explained next, this has the critical importance of enabling interpretability via the\\naggregation of meaningful partial forecasts.\\n3.3\\nINTERPRETABILITY\\nWe propose two conﬁgurations of the architecture, based on the selection of gb\\nℓand gf\\nℓ. One of them\\nis generic DL, the other one is augmented with certain inductive biases to be interpretable.\\nThe generic architecture does not rely on TS-speciﬁc knowledge. We set gb\\nℓand gf\\nℓto be a linear\\nprojection of the previous layer output. In this case the outputs of block ℓare described as:\\nbyℓ= V f\\nℓθ f\\nℓ+bf\\nℓ,\\nbxℓ= Vb\\nℓθ b\\nℓ+bb\\nℓ.\\nThe interpretation of this model is that the FC layers in the basic building block depicted in Fig. 1 learn\\nthe predictive decomposition of the partial forecast byℓin the basis V f\\nℓlearned by the network. Matrix\\nV f\\nℓhas dimensionality H ×dim(θ f\\nℓ). Therefore, the ﬁrst dimension of V f\\nℓhas the interpretation of\\ndiscrete time index in the forecast domain. The second dimension of the matrix has the interpretation\\nof the indices of the basis functions, with θ f\\nℓbeing the expansion coefﬁcients for this basis. Thus the\\ncolumns of V f\\nℓcan be thought of as waveforms in the time domain. Because no additional constraints\\nare imposed on the form of V f\\nℓ, the waveforms learned by the deep model do not have inherent\\nstructure (and none is apparent in our experiments). This leads to byℓnot being interpretable.\\nThe interpretable architecture can be constructed by reusing the overall architectural approach in\\nFig. 1 and by adding structure to basis layers at stack level. Forecasting practitioners often use the\\ndecomposition of time series into trend and seasonality, such as those performed by the STL (Cleveland\\net al., 1990) and X13-ARIMA (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013). We propose to design the trend and\\nseasonality decomposition into the model to make the stack outputs more easily interpretable. Note\\n4'),\n",

Now we will consider both stack level and block level indexing. For example, bys,ℓ\\nwill denote the partial forecast of block ℓwithin stack s.\\nTrend model. A typical characteristic of trend is that most of the time it is a monotonic function, or\\nat least a slowly varying function. In order to mimic this behaviour we propose to constrain gb\\ns,ℓand\\ngf\\ns,ℓto be a polynomial of small degree p, a function slowly varying across forecast window:\\nbys,ℓ=\\np\\n∑\\ni=0\\nθ f\\ns,ℓ,iti.\\n(2)\\nHere time vector t = [0,1,2,...,H −2,H −1]T/H is deﬁned on a discrete grid running from 0 to\\n(H −1)/H, forecasting H steps ahead. Alternatively, the trend forecast in matrix form will then be:\\nbytr\\ns,ℓ= Tθ f\\ns,ℓ,\\nwhere θ f\\ns,ℓare polynomial coefﬁcients predicted by a FC network of layer ℓof stack s described by\\nequations (1); and T = [1,t,...,tp] is the matrix of powers of t. If p is low, e.g. 2 or 3, it forces bytr\\ns,ℓ\\nto mimic trend.\\nSeasonality model. Typical characteristic of seasonality is that it is a regular, cyclical, recurring\\nﬂuctuation. Therefore, to model seasonality, we propose to constrain gb\\ns,ℓand gf\\ns,ℓto belong to the\\nclass of periodic functions, i.e. yt = yt−∆, where ∆is a seasonality period. A natural choice for the\\nbasis to model periodic function is the Fourier series:\\nbys,ℓ=\\n⌊H/2−1⌋\\n∑\\ni=0\\nθ f\\ns,ℓ,i cos(2πit)+θ f\\ns,ℓ,i+⌊H/2⌋sin(2πit),\\n(3)\\nThe seasonality forecast will then have the matrix form as follows:\\nbyseas\\ns,ℓ= Sθ f\\ns,ℓ,\\nwhere θ f\\ns,ℓare Fourier coefﬁcients predicted by a FC network of layer ℓof stack s described by\\nequations (1); and S = [1,cos(2πt),...cos(2π⌊H/2−1⌋t)),sin(2πt),...,sin(2π⌊H/2−1⌋t))] is the\\nmatrix of sinusoidal waveforms. The forecast byseas\\ns,ℓ\\nis then a periodic function mimicking typical\\nseasonal patterns.\\nThe overall interpretable architecture consists of two stacks: the trend stack is followed by the\\nseasonality stack. The doubly residual stacking combined with the forecast/backcast principle result\\nin (i) the trend component being removed from the input window x before it is fed into the seasonality\\nstack and (ii) the partial forecasts of trend and seasonality are available as separate interpretable\\noutputs. Structurally, each of the stacks consists of several blocks connected with residual connections\\nas depicted in Fig. 1 and each of them shares its respective, non-learnable gb\\ns,ℓand gf\\ns,ℓ. The number\\nof blocks is 3 for both trend and seasonality. We found that on top of sharing gb\\ns,ℓand gf\\ns,ℓ, sharing all\\nthe weights across blocks in a stack resulted in better validation performance.\\n3.4\\nENSEMBLING\\nEnsembling is used by all the top entries in the M4-competition. We rely on ensembling as well\\nto be comparable. We found that ensembling is a much more powerful regularization technique\\nthan the popular alternatives, e.g. dropout or L2-norm penalty. The addition of those methods\\nimproved individual models, but was hurting the performance of the ensemble. The core property of\\nan ensemble is diversity. We build an ensemble using several sources of diversity. First, the ensemble\\nmodels are ﬁt on three different metrics: sMAPE, MASE and MAPE, a version of sMAPE that has only\\nthe ground truth value in the denominator. Second, for every horizon H, individual models are trained\\non input windows of different length: 2H,3H,...,7H, for a total of six window lengths. Thus the\\noverall ensemble exhibits a multi-scale aspect. Finally, we perform a bagging procedure (Breiman,\\n1996) by including models trained with different random initializations. We use 180 total models to\\nreport results on the test set (please refer to Appendix B for the ablation of ensemble size). We use\\nthe median as ensemble aggregation function.\\n5'),\n",

The statistical model-\\ning approaches based on exponential smoothing and its different ﬂavors are well established and\\nare often considered a default choice in the industry (Holt, 1957; 2004; Winters, 1960). More\\nadvanced variations of exponential smoothing include the winner of M3 competition, the Theta\\nmethod (Assimakopoulos & Nikolopoulos, 2000) that decomposes the forecast into several theta-lines\\nand statistically combines them. The pinnacle of the statistical approach encapsulates ARIMA,\\nauto-ARIMA and in general, the uniﬁed state-space modeling approach, that can be used to ex-\\nplain and analyze all of the approaches mentioned above (see Hyndman & Khandakar (2008) for\\nan overview). More recently, ML/TS combination approaches started inﬁltrating the domain with\\ngreat success, showing promising results by using the outputs of statistical engines as features. In\\nfact, 2 out of top-5 entries in the M4 competition are approaches of this type, including the second\\nentry (Montero-Manso et al., 2019). The second entry computes the outputs of several statistical\\nmethods on the M4 dataset and combines them using gradient boosted tree (Chen & Guestrin, 2016).\\nSomewhat independently, the work in the modern deep learning TS forecasting developed based on\\nvariations of recurrent neural networks (Flunkert et al., 2017; Rangapuram et al., 2018b; Toubeau\\net al., 2019; Zia & Razzaq, 2018) being largely dominated by the electricity load forecasting in the\\nmulti-variate setup. A few earlier works explored the combinations of recurrent neural networks\\nwith dilation, residual connections and attention (Chang et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017; Qin et al.,\\n2017). These served as a basis for the winner of the M4 competition (Smyl, 2020). The winning\\nentry combines a Holt-Winters style seasonality model with its parameters ﬁtted to a given TS via\\ngradient descent and a unique combination of dilation/residual/attention approaches for each forecast\\nhorizon. The resulting model is a hybrid model that architecturally heavily relies on a time-series\\nengine. It is hand crafted to each speciﬁc horizon of M4, making this approach hard to generalize to\\nother datasets.\\n5\\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\\nOur key empirical results based on aggregate performance metrics over several datasets—M4 (M4\\nTeam, 2018b; Makridakis et al., 2018b), M3 (Makridakis & Hibon, 2000; Makridakis et al., 2018a)\\nand TOURISM (Athanasopoulos et al., 2011)—appear in Table 1. More detailed descriptions of the\\ndatasets are provided in Section 5.1 and Appendix A. For each dataset, we compare our results with\\nbest 5 entries for this dataset reported in the literature, according to the customary metrics speciﬁc to\\neach dataset (M4: OWA and sMAPE, M3: sMAPE, TOURISM: MAPE). More granular dataset-speciﬁc\\nresults with data splits over forecast horizons and types of time series appear in respective appendices\\n(M4: Appendix C.1; M3: Appendix C.2; TOURISM: Appendix C.3).\\nIn Table 1, we study the performance of two N-BEATS conﬁgurations: generic (N-BEATS-G) and\\ninterpretable (N-BEATS-I), as well as N-BEATS-I+G (ensemble of all models from N-BEATS-G and\\nN-BEATS-I). On M4 dataset, we compare against 5 representatives from the M4 competition (Makri-\\n6'),\n",

As an example, on M4 dataset, the OWA gap between N-BEATS and the M4\\nwinner (0.821−0.795 = 0.026) is greater than the gap between the M4 winner and the second entry\\n(0.838−0.821 = 0.017). Generic N-BEATS model uses as little prior knowledge as possible, with\\nno feature engineering, no scaling and no internal architectural components that may be considered\\nTS-speciﬁc. Thus the result in Table 1 leads us to the conclusion that DL does not need support\\nfrom the statistical approaches or hand-crafted feature engineering and domain knowledge to perform\\nextremely well on a wide array of TS forecasting tasks. On top of that, the proposed general\\narchitecture performs very well on three different datasets outperforming a wide variety of models,\\nboth generic and manually crafted to respective dataset, including the winner of M4, a model\\narchitecturally adjusted by hand to each forecast-horizon subset of the M4 data.\\n5.1\\nDATASETS\\nM4 (M4 Team, 2018b; Makridakis et al., 2018b) is the latest in an inﬂuential series of forecasting\\ncompetitions organized by Spyros Makridakis since 1982 (Makridakis et al., 1982). The 100k-series\\ndataset is large and diverse, consisting of data frequently encountered in business, ﬁnancial and\\neconomic forecasting, and sampling frequencies ranging from hourly to yearly. A table with summary\\nstatistics is presented in Appendix A.1, showing wide variability in TS characteristics.\\nM3 (Makridakis & Hibon, 2000) is similar in its composition to M4, but has a smaller overall scale\\n(3003 time series total vs. 100k in M4). A table with summary statistics is presented in Appendix A.2.\\nOver the past 20 years, this dataset has supported signiﬁcant efforts in the design of more optimal\\nstatistical models, e.g. Theta and its variants (Assimakopoulos & Nikolopoulos, 2000; Fiorucci et al.,\\n2016; Spiliotis et al., 2019). Furthermore, a recent publication (Makridakis et al., 2018a) based on a\\nsubset of M3 presented evidence that ML models are inferior to the classical statistical models.\\nTOURISM (Athanasopoulos et al., 2011) dataset was released as part of the respective Kaggle\\ncompetition conducted by Athanasopoulos & Hyndman (2011). The data include monthly, quarterly\\nand yearly series supplied by both governmental tourism organizations (e.g. Tourism Australia, the\\nHong Kong Tourism Board and Tourism New Zealand) as well as various academics, who had used\\nthem in previous studies. A table with summary statistics is presented in Appendix A.3.\\n5.2\\nTRAINING METHODOLOGY\\nWe split each dataset into train, validation and test subsets. The test subset is the standard test set\\npreviously deﬁned for each dataset (M4 Team, 2018a; Makridakis & Hibon, 2000; Athanasopoulos\\net al., 2011). The validation and train subsets for each dataset are obtained by splitting their full train\\nsets at the boundary of the last horizon of each time series. We use the train and validation subsets to\\ntune hyperparameters. Once the hyperparameters are determined, we train the model on the full train\\nset and report results on the test set. Please refer to Appendix D for detailed hyperparameter settings\\n7'),\n",

N-BEATS is implemented and trained in Tensorﬂow (Abadi et al., 2015). We\\nshare parameters of the network across horizons, therefore we train one model per horizon for each\\ndataset. If every time series is interpreted as a separate task, this can be linked back to the multitask\\nlearning and furthermore to meta-learning (see discussion in Section 6), in which a neural network\\nis regularized by learning on multiple tasks to improve generalization. We would like to stress that\\nmodels for different horizons and datasets reuse the same architecture. Architectural hyperparameters\\n(width, number of layers, number of stacks, etc.) are ﬁxed to the same values across horizons and\\nacross datasets (see Appendix D). The fact that we can reuse architecture and even hyperparameters\\nacross horizons indicates that the proposed architecture design generalizes well across time series of\\ndifferent nature. The same architecture is successfully trained on the M4 Monthly subset with 48k\\ntime series and the M3 Others subset with 174 time series. This is a much stronger result than e.g. the\\nresult of S. Smyl (Makridakis et al., 2018b) who had to use very different architectures hand crafted\\nfor different horizons.\\nTo update network parameters for one horizon, we sample train batches of ﬁxed size 1024. We pick\\n1024 TS ids from this horizon, uniformly at random with replacement. For each selected TS id we\\npick a random forecast point from the historical range of length LH immediately preceding the last\\npoint in the train part of the TS. LH is a cross-validated hyperparameter. We observed that for subsets\\nwith large number of time series it tends to be smaller and for subsets with smaller number of time\\nseries it tends to be larger. For example, in massive Yearly, Monthly, Quarterly subsets of M4 LH is\\nequal to 1.5; and in moderate to small Weekly, Daily, Hourly subsets of M4 LH is equal to 10. Given\\na sampled forecast point, we set one horizon worth of points following it to be the target forecast\\nwindow y and we set the history of points of one of lengths 2H,3H,...,7H preceding it to be the\\ninput x to the network. We use the Adam optimizer with default settings and initial learning rate\\n0.001. While optimising the ensemble members relying on the minimization of sMAPE metric, we\\nstop the gradient ﬂows in the denominator to make training numerically stable. The neural network\\ntraining is run with early stopping and the number of batches is determined on the validation set. The\\nGPU based training of one ensemble member for entire M4 dataset takes between 30 min and 2 hours\\ndepending on neural network settings and hardware.\\n5.3\\nINTERPRETABILITY RESULTS\\nFig. 2 studies the outputs of the proposed model in the generic and the interpretable conﬁgurations.\\nAs discussed in Section 3.3, to make the generic architecture presented in Fig. 1 interpretable, we\\nconstrain gθ in the ﬁrst stack to have the form of polynomial (2) while the second one has the form\\nof Fourier basis (3). Furthermore, we use the outputs of the generic conﬁguration of N-BEATS as\\ncontrol group (the generic model of 30 residual blocks depicted in Fig. 1 is divided into two stacks)\\nand we plot both generic (sufﬁx “-G”) and interpretable (sufﬁx “-I”) stack outputs side by side in\\nFig. 2. The outputs of generic model are arbitrary and non-interpretable: either trend or seasonality\\nor both of them are present at the output of both stacks. The magnitude of the output (peak-to-peak)\\nis generally smaller at the output of the second stack. The outputs of the interpretable model exhibit\\ndistinct properties: the trend output is monotonic and slowly moving, the seasonality output is\\nregular, cyclical and has recurring ﬂuctuations. The peak-to-peak magnitude of the seasonality output\\nis signiﬁcantly larger than that of the trend, if signiﬁcant seasonality is present in the time series.\\nSimilarly, the peak-to-peak magnitude of trend output tends to be small when no obvious trend\\nis present in the ground truth signal. Thus the proposed interpretable architecture decomposes its\\nforecast into two distinct components. Our conclusion is that the outputs of the DL model can be\\nmade interpretable by encoding a sensible inductive bias in the architecture. Table 1 conﬁrms that\\nthis does not result in performance drop.\\n6\\nDISCUSSION: CONNECTIONS TO META-LEARNING\\nMeta-learning deﬁnes an inner learning procedure and an outer learning procedure. The inner\\nlearning procedure is parameterized, conditioned or otherwise inﬂuenced by the outer learning\\nprocedure (Bengio et al., 1991). The prototypical inner vs. outer learning is individual learning in\\nthe lifetime of an animal vs. evolution of the inner learning procedure itself over many generations\\nof individuals. To see the two levels, it often helps to refer to two sets of parameters, the inner\\nparameters (e.g. synaptic weights) which are modiﬁed inside the inner learning procedure, and the\\n8'),\n",

The inner learning proceeds through a\\nsequence of stages, each corresponding to a block within the stack of the architecture. Each of the\\nblocks can be thought of as performing the equivalent of an update step which gradually modiﬁes\\nthe expansion coefﬁcients θ f which eventually feed into g f in each block (which get added together\\nto form the ﬁnal prediction). The inner learning procedure takes a single history from a piece of a\\nTS and sees that history as a training set. It produces forward expansion coefﬁcients θ f (see Fig. 1),\\nwhich parametrically map inputs to predictions. In addition, each preceding block modiﬁes the input\\nto the next block by producing backward expansion coefﬁcients θ b, thus conditioning the learning\\nand the output of the next block.

First, Is stacking layers helpful? Second, Does\\nthe architecture based on the combination of layers with different basis functions results in better\\nperformance than the architecture using only one layer type?\\nLayer stacking. We start our study with the generic architecture that consists of stacks of one\\nresidual block of 5 FC layers each of the form Fig. 1 and we increase the number of stacks. Results\\npresented in Table 5 conﬁrm that increasing the number of stacks decreases error and at certain point\\nthe gain saturates. We would like to mention that the network having 30 stack of depth 5 is in fact a\\nvery deep network of total depth 150 layers.\\nBasis synergy. Stacking works well for the interpretable architecture as can be seen in Table 6\\ndepicting the results of ablating the interpretable architecture conﬁguration. Here we experiment\\nwith the architecture that is composed of 2 stacks, stack one is trend model and stack two is the\\nseasonality model. Each stack has variable number of residual blocks and each residual block has 5\\nFC layers. We found that this architecture works best when all weights are shared within stack. We\\nclearly see that increasing the number of layers improves performance. The largest network is 60\\nlayers deep. On top of that, we observe that the architecture that consists of stacks based on different\\nbasis functions wins over the architecture based on the same stack. It looks like chaining stacks of\\ndifferent nature results in synergistic effects. This is logical as function classes that can be modelled\\nby trend and seasonality stacks have small overlap.\\nB.2\\nENSEMBLE SIZE\\nFigure 3 demonstrates that increasing the ensemble size results in improved performance. Most\\nimportantly, according to Figure 3, N-BEATS achieves state-of-the-art performance even if compara-\\ntively small ensemble size of 18 models is used. Therefore, computational efﬁciency of N-BEATS\\ncan be traded very effectively for performance and there is no over-reliance of the results on large\\nensemble size.\\nB.3\\nDOUBLY RESIDUAL STACKING\\nIn Section 3.2 we described the proposed doubly residual stacking (DRESS) principle, which is the\\ntopological foundation of N-BEATS. The topology is based on both (i) running a residual backcast\\nconnection and (ii) producing partial block-level forecasts that are further aggregated at stack and\\nmodel levels to produce the ﬁnal model-level forecast. In this section we conduct a study to conﬁrm\\nthe accuracy effectiveness of this topology compared to several alternatives. The methodology\\nunderlying this study is that we remove either the backcast or partial forecast links or both and track\\nhow this affects the forecasting metrics. We keep the number of parameters in the network for each\\nof the architectural alternatives ﬁxed by using the same number of layers in the network (we used\\ndefault hyperparameter settings reported in Table 18). The architectural alternatives are depicted in\\nFigure 4 and described in detail below.\\n15'),\n",

This\\nﬁgure shows that N-BEATS loses less than 0.5% in terms of OWA performance even if 10 times\\nsmaller ensemble size is used.\\nN-BEATS-DRESS is depicted in Fig. 4a. This is the default conﬁguration of N-BEATS using doubly\\nresidual stacking described in Section 3.2.\\nPARALLEL is depicted in Fig. 4b. This is the alternative where the backward residual connection is\\ndisabled and the overall model input is fed to every block. The blocks then forecast in parallel using\\nthe same input and their individual outputs are summed to make the ﬁnal forecast.\\nNO-RESIDUAL is depicted in Fig. 4c. This is the alternative where the backward residual connection\\nis disabled. Unlike PARALLEL, in this case the backcast forecast of the previous block is fed as input\\nto the next block. Unlike the usual feed-forward network, in the NO-RESIDUAL architecture, each\\nblock makes a partial forecast and their individual outputs are summed to make the ﬁnal forecast.\\nLAST-FORWARD is depicted in Fig. 4d. This is the alternative where the backward residual\\nconnection is active, however the model level forecast is derived only from the last block. So, the\\npartial forward forecasts are disabled. This is the architecture that is closest to the classical residual\\nnetwork.\\nNO-RESIDUAL-LAST-FORWARD is depicted in Fig. 4f. This is the alternative where both\\nbackward residual and the partial forward connections are disabled. This is therefore a simple\\nfeed-forward network, but very deep.\\nThe quantitative ablation study results on the M4 dataset are reported in Tables 7–10. N-BEATS-\\nDRESS model is essentially N-BEATS model in this study. For this study we used ensemble size\\nof 18. Since the ensemble size is 18 for N-BEATS-DRESS, as opposed to 180 used for N-BEATS,\\nthe OWA metric reported in Table 9 for N-BEATS-DRESS is higher than the OWA reported for\\nN-BEATS-G in Table 12. Note that both results align well with OWA reported in Figure 3 for different\\nensemble sizes, as part of the ensemble size ablation conducted in Section B.2.\\nThe results presented in Tables 7–10 demonstrate that the doubly residual stacking topology provides\\na clear overall advantage over the alternative architectures in which either backcast residual links or\\nthe partial forward forecast links are disabled.\\n16'),\n",

We study the performance\\nof two model conﬁgurations: generic (Ours-G) and interpretable (Ours-I), as well as Ours-I+G\\n(ensemble of all models from Ours-G and Ours-I). We compare against 4 representatives from the\\nM4 competition: each best in their respective model class. Best pure ML is the submission by B.\\nTrotta, the best entry among the 6 pure ML models. Best statistical is the best pure statistical model\\nby N.Z. Legaki and K. Koutsouri. Best ML/TS combination is the model by P. Montero-Manso, T.\\nTalagala, R.J. Hyndman and G. Athanasopoulos, second best entry, gradient boosted tree over a few\\nstatistical time series models. Finally, DL/TS hybrid is the winner of M4 competition (Smyl, 2020).\\nN-BEATS outperforms all other approaches on all the studied subsets of time series. The average\\nOWA gap between our generic model and the M4 winner (0.821−0.795 = 0.026) is greater than the\\ngap between the M4 winner and the second entry (0.838−0.821 = 0.017).\\nA more granular and detailed statistical analysis of our results on M4 is provided in Table 13. This\\ntable ﬁrst presents the sMAPE for N-BEATS, decomposed by M4 time series sub-type and sampling\\nfrequency (upper part). Then (lower part), it shows the average sMAPE difference between the\\nN-BEATS results and the M4 winner (TS/DL hybrid by S. Smyl), adding the standard error of that\\ndifference (in parentheses); bold entries indicate statistical signiﬁcance at the 99% level based on a\\ntwo-sided paired t-test.\\nWe note that each cross-section of the M4 dataset into horizon and type may be regarded as an\\nindependent mini-dataset. We observe that over those mini-datasets there is a preponderance of\\nstatistically signiﬁcant differences between N-BEATS and Smyl (18 cases out of 31) to the advantage\\nof N-BEATS. This provides evidence that (i) the improvement observed on average in Tables 11\\nand 12 is statistically signiﬁcant and consistent over smaller subsets of M4 and (ii) N-BEATS\\ngeneralizes well over time series of different types and sampling frequencies.\\n19'),\n",

Below, we list those cases. BaggedETS.BC (Bergmeir\\net al., 2016) has not reported numbers on Others. LGT (Smyl & Kuber, 2016) did not report results on\\nMonthly and Quarterly data. According to the authors, the underlying RNN had problems dealing with\\nraw seasonal data, the ETS based pre-processing was not effective and the LGT pre-processing was\\nnot computationally feasible given comparatively large number of time series and their comparatively\\nlarge length (Smyl & Kuber, 2016). Finally, EXP (Spiliotis et al., 2019) reported average performance\\ncomputed using a different methodology than the default M3 and M4 methodology (source: personal\\ncommunication with the authors). For the latter method we recomputed the Average sMAPE based on\\nthe previously reported Yearly, Quarterly and Monthly splits. To calculate it, we follow the M3, M4\\nand TOURISM competition methodology and compute the average metric as the average over all time\\nseries and over all forecast horizons. Given the performance metric values aggregated over Yearly,\\nQuarterly and Monthly splits, the average can be computed straightforwardly as:\\nsMAPEAverage = NYear\\nNTot\\nsMAPEYear +NQuart\\nNTot\\nsMAPEQuart +NMonth\\nNTot\\nsMAPEMonth +NOthers\\nNTot\\nsMAPEOthers .\\n(5)\\nHere NTot = NYear +NQuart +NMonth +NOthers and NYear = 6×645,NQuart = 8×756,NMonth = 18×\\n1428,NOthers = 8×174. It is clear that for each split, its N is the product of its respective number of\\ntime series and its largest forecast horizon.\\n1With minor differences compared to the sMAPE deﬁnition used for M4. Please refer to Appendix A\\nin (Makridakis & Hibon, 2000) for the mathematical deﬁnition.\\n21'),\n",

The respective Kaggle\\ncompetition was divided into two parts: (i) Yearly time series forecasting and (ii) Quarterly/Monthly\\ntime series forecasting (Athanasopoulos & Hyndman, 2011). Some of the participants chose to\\ntake part only in the second part. Therefore, In addition to entries present in Table 1, we report\\ncompetitors from (Athanasopoulos & Hyndman, 2011) that have missing results in Yearly compe-\\ntition. In particular, SaliMali team is the winner of the Quarterly/Monthly time series forecasting\\ncompetition (Brierley, 2011). Their approach is based on a weighted ensemble of statistical methods.\\nTeams Robert and Idalgo used unknown approaches. We can see from Table 15 that N-BEATS\\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on all subsets of TOURISM dataset. On average, it is state of the\\nart and it gains 4.2% over the best-known approach LeeCBaker, and 11.5% over auto-ARIMA.\\nThe average metrics have not been reported in the original competition results (Athanasopoulos et al.,\\n2011; Athanasopoulos & Hyndman, 2011). Therefore, in Table 15, we present the Average MAPE\\nmetric calculated by us based on the previously reported Yearly, Quarterly and Monthly splits. To\\ncalculate it, we follow the M4 competition methodology and compute the average metric as the\\naverage over all time series and over all forecast horizons. Given the performance metric values\\naggregated over Yearly, Quarterly and Monthly splits, the average can be computed straightforwardly\\nas:\\nMAPEAverage = NYear\\nNTot\\nMAPEYear +NQuart\\nNTot\\nMAPEQuart +NMonth\\nNTot\\nMAPEMonth .\\n(6)\\nHere NTot = NYear +NQuart +NMonth and NYear = 4×518,NQuart = 8×427,NMonth = 24×366. It is\\nclear that for each split, its N is the product of its respective number of time series and its largest\\nforecast horizon.\\n22'),\n",

The results are presented in in Table 16.\\nBoth datasets are aggregated to hourly data, but using different aggregation operations: sum for\\nELECTRICITY and mean for TRAFFIC. The hourly aggregation is done so that all the points available\\nin (h −1 : 00,h : 00] hours are aggregated to hour h, thus if original dataset starts on 2011-01-01\\n00:15 then the ﬁrst time point after aggregation will be 2011-01-01 01:00. For the ELECTRICITY\\ndataset we removed the ﬁrst year from training set, to match the training set used in (Yu et al., 2016),\\nbased on the aggregated dataset downloaded from, presumable authors’, github repository4. We also\\nmade sure that data points for both ELECTRICITY and TRAFFIC datasets after aggregation match\\nthose used in (Yu et al., 2016). The authors of MatFact model were using the last 7 days of datasets\\nas test set, but papers from Amazon are using different splits, where the split points are provided by a\\ndate. Changing split points without a well grounded reason adds uncertainties to the comparability of\\nthe models performances and creates challenges to the reproducibility of the results, thus we were\\ntrying to match all different splits in our experiments. It was especially challenging on TRAFFIC\\ndataset, where we had to use some heuristics to ﬁnd records dates; the dataset authors state: “ The\\nmeasurements cover the period from Jan. 1st 2008 to Mar. 30th 2009” and “ We remove public\\nholidays from the dataset, as well as two days with anomalies (March 8th 2009 and March 9th 2008)\\nwhere all sensors were muted between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. ” , but we failed to match a part of the\\nprovided labels of week days to actual dates. Therefore, we had to assume that the actual list of gaps,\\nwhich include holidays and anomalous days, is the following:\\n1. Jan. 1, 2008 (New Year’s Day)\\n2. Jan. 21, 2008 (Martin Luther King Jr. Day)\\n3. Feb. 18, 2008 (Washington’s Birthday)\\n4. Mar. 9, 2008 (Anomaly day)\\n5. May 26, 2008 (Memorial Day)\\n6. Jul. 4, 2008 (Independence Day)\\n7. Sep. 1, 2008 (Labor Day)\\n8. Oct. 13, 2008 (Columbus Day)\\n9. Nov. 11, 2008 (Veterans Day)\\n10. Nov. 27, 2008 (Thanksgiving)\\n11. Dec. 25, 2008 (Christmas Day)\\n12. Jan. 1, 2009 (New Year’s Day)\\n13. Jan. 19, 2009 (Martin Luther King Jr. Day)\\n14. Feb. 16, 2009 (Washington’s Birthday)\\n15. Mar. 8, 2009 (Anomaly day)\\nThe ﬁrst 6 gaps were conﬁrmed by the gaps in labels, but the rest were more than 1 day apart from any\\npublic holiday of years 2008 and 2009 in San Francisco, California and US. More over the number of\\ngaps we found in the labels provided by dataset authors is 10, while the number of days between Jan.\\n1st 2008 and Mar. 30th 2009 is 455, assuming that Jan. 1st 2008 was skipped from the values and\\nlabels we should end up with either 454−10 = 444 instead of 440 days or different end date.\\nThe metric is reported in Normalized deviation (ND) as in (Yu et al., 2016) which is equal to p50\\nloss used in DeepAR, Deep State, and Deep Factors papers.\\n2https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014\\n3https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/PEMS-SF\\n4https://github.com/rofuyu/exp-trmf-nips16/blob/master/python/exp-scripts/datasets/download-data.sh\\n23'),\n",

Exist-\\ning domain generalization techniques embark\\nupon stationary and discrete environments to\\ntackle the generalization issue caused by OOD\\ndata. However, many real-world tasks in non-\\nstationary environments\\n(e.g., self-driven car\\nsystem, sensor measures) involve more complex\\nand continuously evolving domain drift, which\\nraises new challenges for the problem of do-\\nmain generalization. In this paper, we formu-\\nlate the aforementioned setting as the problem of\\nevolving domain generalization.

Introduction\\nThe success of machine learning techniques typically lies on\\nthe assumption that training data and test data are sampled\\nindependently and identically from similar distributions.\\nHowever, this assumption does not hold when deploying the\\ntrained model in many real-world environments where the\\ndistribution of test data varies from training data.

Copy-\\nright 2022 by the author(s).\\nto the dramatic performance decrease of machine learning\\nmodels (Torralba & Efros, 2011). To mitigate this issue,\\ndomain generalization (DG) has been proposed to learn a\\nmore robust model which can be better generalized to OOD\\ndata (Muandet et al., 2013; Balaji et al., 2018; Li et al.,\\n2018b).\\nWhile some progress is being achieved so far, existing DG\\nmethods are limited to the setting of generalization among\\ndiscrete and stationary environments. This setting can be\\nproblematic in some real-world applications where we re-\\nquire that model can be generalized among continuous do-\\nmains (Hoffman et al., 2014). For example, a self-driving\\ncar system, when deployed in the real world, struggles to\\nperform under an open environment where the accepted data\\nchanges naturally according to the geographic location, time\\nintervals, and other factors in a gradual manner (Hoffman\\net al., 2014). For another example, the measures of sen-\\nsors can also drift over time due to the outer environments\\nand inter factors, such as aging (Vergara et al., 2012). In\\nthese scenarios, treating each domain in a separate manner\\nis unlikely to yield the desired performance as it does not\\nconsider the property of continuous domain structure.\\nAnother limitation of most of the existing DG methods is\\nthat they did not take “concept shift” into consideration.\\nSuch concept shift can also lead to performance drop (Fed-\\nerici et al., 2021). A typical example of concept shift would\\nbe that the incidence rate of a particular disease in cer-\\ntain groups may change over time due to the development\\nof treatments and preventive measures. Therefore, exist-\\ning DG techniques may fail to be applied to some other\\ncomplex real-world applications in non-stationary environ-\\nments (Sugiyama et al., 2013; Tahmasbi et al., 2021).\\nIn this paper, we propose to focus on the problem of domain\\ngeneralization based on the non-stationary setting, where\\ndata can evolve gradually with both covariate shift and con-\\ncept shift. Particularly, we formulate this non-stationary\\nscenario as evolving domain generalization where we only\\nhave access to adequate labeled examples from the sequen-\\ntial source domains. Our objective is to develop algorithms\\nthat can explore the underlying continuous structure of dis-\\ntribution shift and generalize well to evolving target domains\\nwhere the samples are unavailable during the training stage.\\narXiv:2205.07649v2  [cs.LG]  16 Jun 2022'),\n",

We conduct extensive ex-\\nperiments to verify that our framework can successfully\\ncapture the underlying covariate shift and interpret the con-\\ncept shift simultaneously. Last but not least, we show that\\nour proposed LSSAE has a promising generation capability\\nto predict unseen target domains, which can be helpful to\\nthe problem related to sequential data generation. The main\\ncontributions of this paper are summarized as follows.\\n• We propose to focus on the problem of non-stationary\\nevolving domain generalization where both covariate\\nshift and concept shift may exist in the setting.\\n• We propose a novel probabilistic framework LSSAE\\nwhich incorporates variational inference to identify the\\ncontinuous latent structures of these two shifts sepa-\\nrately and simultaneously.\\n• We provide empirical results to show that the proposed\\napproach yield better results than other DG methods\\nacross scenarios. Besides, it presents a powerful gener-\\nation ability of predicting unseen evolving domains.\\n2. Related Work\\nDomain Generalization (DG). The goal of DG is to learn\\nrobust models which can generalize well towards the out-\\nof-distribution samples from unseen domains. Existing DG\\nmethods commonly rely on multiple source domains to learn\\nrepresentative features that can be better generalized. Ac-\\ncording to various strategies used to learn these representa-\\ntions, we can roughly categorize them into three catogories.\\nThe ﬁrst type is feature-based methods, which aim to learn\\ndomain-invariant representation which can be better gener-\\nalized to target domains. Speciﬁcally, it can be achieved by\\naligning the distribution of representations from all source\\ndomains (Blanchard et al., 2011; Li et al., 2018b; Albu-\\nquerque et al., 2021) and feature disentanglement (Ilse et al.,\\n2020; Wang et al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2021). The second\\ncategory is meta-learning based methods, which utilize the\\nmodel agnostic training procedure to stimulate the train/test\\nshift for acquiring generalized models (Li et al., 2018a; Bal-\\naji et al., 2018; Dou et al., 2019). Last but not least, data\\naugmentation-based techniques, which aim to manipulate\\nthe perturbation both in original images and features to stim-\\nulate the unseen target domains, can also beneﬁt the problem\\nof domain generalization (Volpi et al., 2018; Shankar et al.,\\n2018; Zhou et al., 2021).\\nContinuous Domain Adaptation (CDA). The problem of\\ncontinuous domain adaptation (i.e., evolving domain adap-\\ntation) has attracted increasing attention recently, where\\nthe CDA methods can be categorized into the intermediate-\\ndomains based methods (Kumar et al., 2020; Gong et al.,\\n2019; Chen & Chao, 2021), domain manifold based meth-\\nods (Hoffman et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017), adversary-based\\napproaches (Wang et al., 2020; Wulfmeier et al., 2018), and\\nmeta-learning based methods (Liu et al., 2020; Lao et al.,\\n2020). More or less, they require some samples from tar-\\nget domains for adaptation. In Mancini et al. (2019), they\\npropose to substitute this reliance with some metadata from\\ntarget domains as additional supervision. Instead, our focus\\nis continuous domain generalization where no information\\nfrom target domains is accessible for model learning, which\\nis a more challenging but realistic task for real-world appli-\\ncations.\\nSequential Data Generation. Recent process in unsuper-\\nvised sequence generation (Yingzhen & Mandt, 2018; Han\\net al., 2021; Park et al., 2021) suggests the importance of\\ndecoupling time-invariant and time-variant information dur-\\ning the representation learning procedure. However, these\\napproaches only take sequence generation tasks into consid-\\neration and fail to consider the category-related information,\\nwhich is important for the problem of domain generalization.\\nUnlike these approaches, we propose jointly focusing on\\nthe dynamic modeling of time-variant information on both\\ndata sample space and category space across domains.\\n3. Methodology\\nIn this section, we ﬁrst formalize the problem of evolving\\ndomain generalization based on the non-stationary environ-\\nment and then describe our framework LSSAE for address-\\ning this problem. After that, we will provide theoretical\\nanalysis for the proposed framework in Sec. 3.3 and imple-\\nmentation in Sec. 3.4.\\n3.1. Problem Formulation\\nSuppose we are given T sequentially arriving source do-\\nmains S = {D1, D2, ..., DT }, where each domain Dt =\\n{(xt,i, yt,i)}nt\\ni=1 is comprised of nt labeled samples for\\nt ∈{1, 2, ..., T}.\\nThe goal of our problem setting is\\nto train a classiﬁcation model on S which can be gen-\\neralized to M following arriving target domains T\\n=\\n{DT +1, DT +2, ..., DT +M}, Dt = {(xt,i)}nt\\ni=1 (t ∈{T +\\n1, T + 2, ..., T + M}), which are not available during\\ntraining stage. For simplicity, we omit the index i when-\\never xi refers to a single data point. To further quantify\\nthe continuously evolving nature of domains, we denote'),\n",

To tackle this problem, in this\\npaper, we aim to explore the evolving patterns of covariate\\nshift and concept shift across domains.\\n3.2. LSSAE: Latent Structure-aware Sequential\\nAutoencoder\\nTo model the dynamic in non-stationary systems, we con-\\nsider two independent factors W and V (i.e., W ⊥⊥V )\\nwhich account for the distribution drift in data sample space\\n(i.e., covariate shift) and data category space (i.e., con-\\ncept shift) respectively according to different time stamps\\n(See Fig. 1 (d)). For data (xt, yt) collected at time stamp t,\\nwe denote zw\\nt and zv\\nt as the latent variables of W and V at\\ntime stamp t. For completeness, we further consider time-\\ninvariant latent code zc to capture the static information of\\nxt. We thus can deﬁne a probabilistic generative model for\\nthe joint distribution of all source domains as\\np(x1:T , y1:T , zc, zw\\n1:T , zv\\n1:T )\\n= p(x1:T , zw\\n1:T , zc)p(y1:T , zv\\n1:T |zc).\\n(1)\\nwhere the ﬁrst term p(x1:T , zw\\n1:T , zc) and second term\\np(y1:T , zv\\n1:T |x1:T ) can be formulated by using Markov\\nchain model as\\np(x1:T , zw\\n1:T , zc) = p(zc)\\nT\\nY\\nt=1\\np(zw\\nt |zw\\n<t) p(xt|zc, zw\\nt )\\n|\\n{z\\n}\\ncovariate shift\\n,\\n(2)\\np(y1:T , zv\\n1:T |zc) =\\nT\\nY\\nt=1\\np(zv\\nt |zv\\n<t) p(yt|zc, zv\\nt )\\n|\\n{z\\n}\\nconcept shift\\n,\\n(3)\\nand p(xt|zc, zw\\nt ) and p(yt|zc, zv\\nt ) denote covariate shift and\\nconcept shift, respectively. Eq. 2 shows that the generation\\nprocess of domains data xt at time stamp t depends on the\\ncorresponding dynamic latent code zw\\nt and static code zc,\\nand Eq. 3 shows that the inference process (i.e., classiﬁer to\\nproduce yt) rely on the corresponding zv\\nt and zc. Our ob-\\njective is to learn the classiﬁer p(yt|zc, zv\\nt ) which disposes\\nof covariate shift through zc and concept shift with dynamic\\nzv\\nt for the problem of evolving domain generalization.\\nDomain-related module for covariate shift. To model\\np(x1:T , zw\\n1:T , zc) where covariate shift involved, we set\\nthe prior distribution as p(zc) = N(0, I), p(zw\\nt |zw\\n<t) =\\nN(µ(zw\\nt ), σ2(zw\\nt )) which can be parameterized by some re-\\ncurrent neural networks (e.g., LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmid-\\nhuber, 1997)) by setting zw\\n0 = 0 for initial state when t = 0,\\nand p(xt|zc, zw\\nt ) as a conditional decoder for the reconstruc-\\ntion of input data xt. To approximate the prior distributions\\np(zw\\nt |zw\\n<t), we propose to use variational inference to learn\\nan approximate posterior distribution q over latent variables\\ngiven data which can be formulated as\\nq(zw\\n1:T , zc|x1:T ) = q(zc|x1:T )\\nT\\nY\\nt=1\\nq(zw\\nt |zw\\n<t, xt),\\n(4)\\nwhere q(zc|x1:T ) and q(zw\\nt |zw\\n<t, xt) can be also parameter-\\nized by neural networks.

An overview of network architecture for LSSAE. Our\\nframework consists of the static variational encoding network Ec,\\ndynamic variational encoding networks Ew and Ev, dynamic prior\\nnetworks F w and F v, a decoder D and a classiﬁer C. It is worth\\nnoting that we do not require Ev (i.e., only data from target domain\\nT available) during inference stage.\\n3.4. Implementation\\nThe implementation of network architecture for LSSAE is\\ndepicted in Fig. 2. It is composed of two parts: (1) the\\ndomain-related module (middle and bottom region); (2) the\\ncategory-related module (top region).\\nThe domain-related module consists of a static variational\\nencoding network Ec for q(zc|x1:T ), a dynamic variational\\nencoding network Ew associated with q(zw\\nt |zw\\n<t, xt), a dy-\\nnamic prior network F w working for p(zw\\nt |zw\\n<t) and a de-\\ncoder D corresponding to p(xt|zc, zw\\nt ). Similar to VAE\\n(Kingma & Welling, 2014), we can apply the reparameteri-\\nzation trick (Kingma & Welling, 2014) to optimize param-\\neters of Ec, Ew and F w. Speciﬁcally, we implement Ec\\nby a feature extractor which will be also utilized to extract\\nfeatures during test time. Ew can be implemented by a\\nfeature extractor with same architecture of Ec but not shar-\\ning network parameters, and followed by a LSTM network.\\nF w is implemented as a one-layer LSTM network. For the\\ncategory-related module, we design a dynamic inference\\nnetwork Ew which takes the one-hot code of label yt as\\nthe input and with the output of the categorical distribution\\nq(zv\\nt |zv\\n<t, yt), and a classiﬁer C which takes zc and zv\\nt as\\nthe input for p(yt|zc, zv\\nt ). Similarly, the prior network F v\\nfor p(zv\\nt |zv\\n<t) is a LSTM network with a categorical distri-\\nbution as the output. After that, we use Gumbel-Softmax\\nreparameterization trick (Jang et al., 2017; Maddison et al.,\\n2017) to sample zv\\nt for optimization. Regarding the clas-\\nsiﬁer C, we utilize a linear layer by following Gulrajani\\n& Lopez-Paz (2021). The details of our architecture and\\nhyperparameters for objective function can be found in the\\nsupplementary material.\\nOptimization. We ﬁrst initialize zw and zv as zw\\n0 = 0 and'),\n",

The classiﬁer C takes zc and zv\\nt as the input\\nto predict the labels of xt. During training, we sample a\\nmini-batch from each single domain with the same number\\nof data sample to form a large batch in order to suit our\\nframework to the temporal smooth constraint for stable\\ntraining. This optimization procedure of LSSAE is depicted\\nin Algorithm 1.\\nInference.\\nTo predict the label of xt sampled from one\\nof the target domains in Dt in T , we adopt F v to infer the\\nlatent code zv\\nt and Ec to extract the latent features zc, and\\nthen apply the classiﬁer C for the prediction purpose. It is\\nworth noting that we do not require Ev (i.e., only data from\\ntarget domain T available) during inference stage. We show\\nthis procedure in Algorithm 2.\\n4. Experiments\\nIn this section, we present experimental results to validate\\nthe effectiveness of our proposed LSSAE based on the set-\\nting of evolving domain generalization.\\n4.1. Experimental Setup\\nWe compare the proposed LSSAE with other DG methods\\non two synthetic datesets (Circle and Sine) and four real-\\nworld datasets (Rotated MNIST, Portraits, Caltran, Power-\\nSupply). We also evaluate the results on two variants named\\nCircle-C and Sine-C derived from Circle and Sine via syn-\\nthesizing concept shift manually. We split the domains into\\nsource domains, intermediate domains and target domains\\nwith the ratio of {1/2 : 1/6 : 1/3}. The intermediate do-\\nmains are utilized as validation set. More details of dataset\\nconstruction can be found in the supplementary material.\\n(1) Circle/-C (Pesaranghader & Viktor, 2016). This dataset\\ncontains evolving 30 domains where the instance are sam-\\npled from 30 2D Gaussian distributions. For Circle-C, con-\\ncept shift is introduced via changing the center and radius\\nof decision boundary in a gradual manner over time.\\n(2) Sine/-C (Pesaranghader & Viktor, 2016). We rearrange\\nthis dataset by extending it to 24 evolving domains. To\\nsimulate concept drift for Sine-C, labels are reversed (i.e.,\\nAlgorithm 1 Optimization procedure for LSSAE\\nInput: sequential source labeled datasets S; static feature\\nextractor Ec; dynamic inference networks Ew, Ev and\\ntheir corresponding prior networks F w, F v; decoder D\\nand classiﬁer C.\\nRandomly initialize Ec, Ew, Ev, F w, F v, D, C\\nAssign zw\\n0 , zv\\n0 ←0\\nfor t = 1, 2, ..., K do\\nGenerate prior distribution p(zw\\nt |zw\\n<t) via F w\\nGenerate prior distribution p(zv\\nt |zv\\n<t) via F v\\nfor i = 1, 2, ... do\\nSample a batch of data (xt, yt) from St\\n▷Calculate Ld by Eq. 5 for Ec, Ew, D and F w\\n▷Calculate Lc by Eq. 7 for Ec, Ev, C and F v\\n▷Calculate temporal smooth constriction by Eq. 8\\nUpdate all modules by the summary of these loss\\nend for\\nend for\\nAlgorithm 2 Inference procedure for LSSAE\\nInput: sequential target datasets T ; static feature extrac-\\ntor Ec; dynamic prior network F v and classiﬁer C.\\nAssign zv\\n0 ←0\\nfor t = 1, 2, ... do\\nSample zv\\nt ∼p(zv\\nt |zv\\n<t) via F v\\nfor i = 1, 2, ... do\\n▷Extract the feature for data xt via Ec\\n▷Generate the prediction ˜yt via C\\nend for\\nend for\\nfrom 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) from the 6-th domain to the last\\none.\\n(3) Rotated MNIST (RMNIST) (Ghifary et al., 2015).

Quantitative Results\\nThe results of of our proposed LSSAE and baselines are\\npresented in Table 1. As conventional DG methods focus\\nupon covariate shift only, we separate the datasets according\\nto with or without concept shift into two parts for fairness.\\nWe can see that LSSAE consistently outperforms other base-\\nlines over all datasets, it achieves 70.3% accuracy when\\nthere exists covariate shift only (Circle, Sine, RMNIST, Por-\\ntraits and Caltran), and achieves 58.9% accuracy when there\\nexist concept shift (Circle-C, Sine-C, PowerSupply). The\\nresults are signiﬁcantly better than the compared DG ap-\\nproaches, which are reasonable since existing DG methods\\ncannot deal with distribution shift well in non-stationary\\nenvironments but our proposed LSSAE can properly cap-\\nture the evolving patterns to gain better performance. More\\nresults can be found in the supplementary materials.\\nTo better understand the rationality of our method, we vi-\\nsualize the decision boundaries of our method and ERM\\nbaseline on two synthetic datasets: Circle and Sine by com-\\nparing our proposed method with ERM baseline.

As for Circle-C where we\\nintroduce evolving concept shift via modifying the center\\nand radius of decision boundary over a period of time, we\\nobserve that our proposed LSSAE can still produce a more\\naccurate decision boundary compared with ERM. Similar\\nobservation can be found in Fig. 4, where LSSAE can be\\nbetter generalized to evolving domains compared with ERM.\\nHowever, we ﬁnd that our proposed LSSAE may not be able'),\n",

Ablation Study\\nAnalysis on domain-related module. To better evaluate\\nwhether our proposed LSSAE can capture domain spe-\\nciﬁc information, we conduct experiments by evaluating\\nthe reconstruction and generation capability of LSSAE on\\nRMNIST dataset. The reconstruction and generation re-\\nsults are shown in Fig. 5. Each subﬁgure shows two se-\\nquences which follow the domain order (i.e., rotation degree\\ngradually evolves) from the left to the right. Subﬁgure (a)\\nshows the original data sequence sampled from source do-\\nmains (green bounding box), intermediate domains (orange\\nbounding box) and target domains (pink bounding box) in\\norder. Noted that we are only interested in degree of rota-\\ntion thus the category of images from different domains may\\nnot be consistent. Subﬁgure (b) shows the reconstructions\\nfor each sample in Subﬁgure (a). Based on the results, we\\nﬁnd that we can achieve a desired reconstruction quality,\\nwhich suggests that the domain-related information can be\\ncaptured even we random the category related information.\\nTo further show that our proposed method is capable for\\ngeneration task, in subﬁgure (c), we visualize the randomly\\ngenerated samples using zw\\nt ∼p(zw\\nt |zw\\n<t) while keeping zc\\nthe same for all domains. We can see that the category infor-\\nmation (i.e., digit information) remains unchanged when we\\nﬁx zc, and can generated samples for unseen future domains\\nwhere the rotation degree of digit is gradually changed with\\nevolving prior p(zw\\nt |zw\\n<t). This observation suggests that\\nour proposed method can be used for data augmentation\\nwhen adapting to the unseen target domains. However, we\\nalso observe that there exists image quality distortion when\\ngenerating new domains. We conjecture the reason that the\\nTable 2.

We then evaluate\\nthe effectiveness of our proposed category-related module\\non PowerSupply dataset. To this end, we consider three\\ndifferent ablation studies by 1) removing category-related\\nmodule, 2) replacing the learnable categorical prior with a\\nlearnable Gaussian prior, 3) replacing the learnable categor-\\nical prior with a ﬁx Uniform prior. The results are shown\\nin Table 2. As we can see, our proposed LSSAE based on\\ncategorical prior can achieve the best performance among\\nother baselines, which shows the effectiveness of our pro-\\nposed method. However, we observe that the performance\\ndrops to some extent by replacing the categorical prior with\\nGaussian prior, which we conjecture the reason that cate-\\ngorical distribution can better capture the category related\\ninformation which is discrete. We also observe that better\\nperformance can be achieved by comparing with the results\\nusing Uniform distribution as prior, which is reasonable\\nsince Uniform distribution does not change over time.\\nAnalysis on temporal smooth constraint.\\nThe smooth\\nconstraint is mainly designed for stabilizing the training\\nprocedure. To verify this, we conduct experiments by con-\\nsidering “with & without this constraint” on RMNIST and\\nCalTran datasets while keeping other hyperparameters the\\nsame. The results are reported as the variance of the test\\naccuracy in the last ﬁve epochs (See Table 3). For RMNIST,\\nwhen training with constraint, the variance is 0.4; without\\nconstraint, the variance is 3.6. For CalTran, when training\\nwith constraint, the variance is 4.7, and without constraint,\\nthe variance is 10.0. We can see that there exists an obvious\\ndecrease in terms of variance when incorporating with our\\nproposed TS constraint. Besides, as our smooth constraint\\nhelps stabilize the training process, better performance can\\nbe expected. For RMNIST, training with our smooth con-\\nstraint can achieve 0.9% performance gain; For CalTran,'),\n",

Experimental results\\non both toy data and real-world datasets across multiple\\ndomains further indicate the signiﬁcance of our proposed\\nmethod based on this setting.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis work was supported in part by CityU New Research\\nInitiatives/Infrastructure Support from Central (APRC\\n9610528), CityU Applied Research Grant (ARG 9667244)\\nand Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Commission\\n(InnoHK Project CIMDA).

Proofs\\nA.1. Derivation of ELBO for Stationary Environments\\nAs we introduce two latent variables to account for the two types of distribution shift, the data generating procedure for one\\ndomain can be expressed as:\\np(x, y, zc, zw, zv) = p(zc)p(zw)p(zv)p(x|zc, zw)p(y|zc, zv)\\n= p(zw)p(zv)\\nN\\nY\\ni=1\\np(zc\\ni )p(xi|zc\\ni , zw)p(yi|zc\\ni , zv)\\n(14)\\nWe let (zc, zw) be the latent variables for x, and zv be latent variable for y, thus the distribution of these three latent\\nvariables can be inferred from the observable datapoints as p(zc|x),p(zw|x), p(zv|y), respectively. The joint distribution of\\nlatent variables is:\\np(zc, zw, zv|x, y) = p(zc|x)p(zw|x)p(zv|y)\\n(15)\\nFor our approximating distribution in Eq 15, we can choose the form q(zc, zw, zv|x, y) = q(zc|x)q(zw|x)q(zv|y). Thus,\\nwe can get:\\nDKL(q, p) = Eq log q(zc, zw, zv|x, y)\\np(zc, zw, zv|x, y)\\n= Eq log q(zc, zw, zv|x, y)\\np(x, y, zc, zw, zv)p(x, y)\\n= Eq log q(zc, zw, zv|x, y)\\np(x, y, zc, zw, zv) + Eq log p(x, y)\\n= Eq log q(zc, zw, zv|x, y)\\np(x, y, zc, zw, zv) + log p(x, y)\\n(16)\\nWe can get:\\nlog p(x, y) = DKL(q, p) + Eq log p(x, y, zc, zw, zv)\\nq(zc, zw, zv|x, y)\\n(17)\\nAs DKL(q, p) ≥0, the variational lower bound for log p(x, y) is:\\nL = Eq log p(x, y, zc, zw, zv)\\nq(zc, zw, zv|x, y) .\\n(18)\\nThis formulation can be reorganized as:\\nL = Eq log p(x, y|zc, zw, zv)p(zc)p(zw)p(zv)\\nq(zc|x)q(zw|x)q(zv|y)\\n= Eq log p(x, y|zc, zw, zv) + Eq log p(zc)\\nq(zc|x) + Eq log p(zw)\\nq(zw|x) + Eq log p(zv)\\nq(zv|y)\\n= Eq log p(x, y|zc, zw, zv) −DKL(q(zc|x), p(zc)) −DKL(q(zw|x), p(zw)) −DKL(q(zv|y), p(zv)).\\n(19)\\nAs p(x, y|zc, zw, zv) = p(x|zc, zw)p(y|zc, zv), the above formulation can be rewrote as:\\nL ≥Eq log p(x|zc, zw)p(y|zc, zv) −DKL(q(zc|x), p(zc)) −DKL(q(zw|x), p(zw)) −DKL(q(zv|y), p(zv)).\\n(20)\\nA.2. Derivation of ELBO for Non-stationary Environments\\nWe assume the prior distribution of latent variables zw and zv satisfy Markov property. This means each of them relies on\\nthe value of their previous states:\\np(zw) = p(zw\\nt |zw\\n<t), p(zv) = p(zv\\nt |zv\\n<t),\\n(21)'),\n",

The label is\\nassigned using a circle curve as the decision boundary following (x −x0)2 + (y −y0)2 ≤r2, where (x0, y0) are the\\nlocation of the center and r is the radius of this circle. To generate Circle-C, we inject gradual shift via modifying the\\nvalue of x0 continuously throughout the domains.\\n• Sine (Pesaranghader & Viktor, 2016): Each data in this dataset owns two attributes (x, y), x, y ∈[0, 1]. The label is\\nassigned using a sine curve as the decision boundary following y ≤sin(x). To simulate abrupt concept drift for Sine-C,\\nlabels are reversed (i.e., from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) from the 6-th domain to the last one.\\n• RMNIST (Ghifary et al., 2015): This dataset is composed of MNIST digits of various rotations. We generate 19\\ndomains via applying the rotations with degree of R = {0◦, 15◦, 30◦, ..., 180◦} on each domain. Note that each image\\nis seen at exactly one angle, so the training procedure cannot track a single image across different angles.\\n• Portraits (Ginosar et al., 2015): This is a real-world dataset of photos collected in American high school seniors. The\\nportraits are taken over 108 years (1905-2013) across 26 states. The goal is to classify the gender for each photo. We\\nsplit the dataset into 34 domains by a ﬁxed internal along time.\\n• CalTran (Hoffman et al., 2014): This dataset contains real-world images captured by a ﬁxed trafﬁc camera deployed in\\nan intersection over time. Frames were updated at 3 minute intervals each with a resolution 320 × 320. We divide\\nit into 34 domains by time. This is a scene classiﬁcation task to determine whether one or more cars are present in,\\nor approaching the intersection. The challenge mainly raise from the continually evolving domain shift as changes\\ninclude time, illumination, weather, etc.\\n• PowerSupply (Dau et al., 2019): This dataset is comprised of records of hourly power supply collected by an Italy\\nelectricity company. We form 30 domains according to days. Each data is assigned by a binary class label which\\nrepresents which time of day the current power supply belongs to (i.e., am or pm). The concept shift may results from\\nthe change in season, weather, price or the differences between working days and weekend.\\nC.2.

Additional Experimental Results\\nIn this section, we provide more experimental results for our proposed evolving domain generalization task. As we can see,\\nin most of the cases, we can achieve the state-of-the-art performance compared with other domain generalization baselines.\\nHowever, in some cases, our proposed method cannot achieve desired results. For example, in Sine-C, ERM and some\\ndomain generalization baselines can achieve a desired classiﬁcation performance especially for domain index 17,18 and 19,\\nwhich we conjecture the reason that their decision boundaries overﬁt to the abrupt concept shift, which further leads to their\\npoor performance on the following domains after domain 19. However, our proposed method aims to learn the evolving\\npattern starting from t = 0, which may not be optimal to suit to this abrupt concept shift case. One possible future direction\\nis only to learn the evolving pattern in a certain time duration (i.e., time duration in [t −T0, t], where t is the current time\\nstamp). Nevertheless, our proposed method shows its effectiveness in dynamic modeling for evolving domain generalization\\ntask. We will leave the discussion how to ﬁnd a suitable time duration (i.e., a suitable T0) in our future work.\\nTable 12. Circle.
